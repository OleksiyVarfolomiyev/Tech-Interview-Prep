This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)


df <- tibble(x=c(1, NA, 3))
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))

library(RMySQL)
dbCredentialsFile <- read.csv("database_credentials.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(),
                 user = dbCredentialsFile$user[1],
                 password = dbCredentialsFile$password[1],
                 host = dbCredentialsFile$host[1],
                 dbname = dbCredentialsFile$dbname[1])

# Use tidyverse to query SQL database
tbl(src = con, "departments")
```
# use SQL in R Markdown
```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "M1_results"}

select * from departments
```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
