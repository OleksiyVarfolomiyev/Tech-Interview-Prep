http://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-biggest-winners-in-the-stock-markets-hottest-sector-in-august-2018-08-29,"What a difference a couple of months can make. The U.S. stock market is back to setting records, and the information technology sector has been leading the way.

There was an endless flow of gloomy headlines after the S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% declined significantly from its Jan. 26 closing high, but the benchmark index eventually recovered and started hitting new records on Aug. 24. During August, the index has gained 3.1%, with dividends reinvested. Here’s how the large-cap sectors have performed:

Total returns S&P 500 sector July 31 through Aug. 28 2018 2017 3 years 5 years Information Technology 6.0% 20.0% 39% 103% 181% Telecommunications 4.6% -1.9% -1% 24% 35% Consumer Discretionary 4.1% 18.3% 23% 61% 117% Health Care 3.8% 12.7% 22% 35% 104% Real Estate 2.7% 4.7% 11% 30% 69% Financials 2.3% 3.3% 22% 58% 99% Industrials 0.9% 3.2% 21% 56% 90% Utilities 0.8% 3.0% 12% 37% 70% Consumer Staples 0.7% -4.2% 13% 23% 57% Materials 0.2% 0.0% 24% 46% 64% Energy -2.9% 5.2% -1% 25% 5% S&P 500 Index 3.1% 9.7% 22% 55% 96% Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.02% 2.9% 7.0% 28% 69% 98% Source: FactSet

That’s remarkable performance for the month, and the benchmark index is now up 9.7% for 2018. Considering that its average annual return over the very long term is about 10%, this may turn out to be a typically decent year for the market after all, supported in part by U.S. consumers who are feeling good about the economy.

Semiconductors still cheap

Advanced Micro Devices AMD, -3.23% has been the best tech performer in August. Ryan Shrout just interviewed AMD CEO Lisa Su, who discussed the company’s product-development plans.

There are two semiconductor manufacturers on the list — AMD and Nvidia NVDA, +0.83% Among the S&P 500, this industry group has been volatile, but has also been a remarkably good performer. Here’s a 12-month chart showing the group’s outperformance against the index:

You can see that a short-term investor could have gotten creamed holding semiconductor stocks, even though their overall performance for 12 months have been stellar.

Here’s a five-year chart, smoothing out the volatility and underlining how well the semiconductor industry has performed:

Cheap valuations

Even though the semiconductors have been such good long-term performers, they trade at low valuations as a group to estimated earnings. Here are price-to-earnings ratios, based on weighted mean estimates among analysts polled by FactSet:

• S&P 500: 16.9

• S&P 500 information technology sector: 19.2

• S&P 500 semiconductors subsector: 13.5

• S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment manufacturers: 13.1

One way to play chip makers and their equipment suppliers is the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX, -0.19%

The ETF has underperformed the S&P 500 semiconductor subsector and the information technology sector over the past 12 months:

Don’t react to headlines

You’re no doubt seeing frightening headlines every day about how the bull market must end. Of course it will end. They always do. But if you are a long-term investor with a diversified portfolio, customary performance for the stock market over a period of years will typically be better than it is for other asset classes.

A bearish market guru who is constantly saying the market will fall will eventually be correct. A stopped clock is correct twice a day. Then the guru can brag for years about how he or she predicted the decline, conveniently leaving out all the gains investors would have missed over the years if they had listened to the warnings. Here are two stories illustrating this point:

• Chart of shame: The S&P 500 vs. everyone who said the market was about to crash

• If market reporters were ‘totally honest,’ their stories would look more like this

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-jc-penneys-struggle-to-identify-its-core-customer-is-putting-it-at-risk-2018-08-24,"J.C. Penney Co. Inc. is out of step with the rest of the retail sector.

As rivals stage a steady rebound from the weakness of the last few years, the Plano, Texas–based department-store chain JCP, -1.69% has deteriorating financials, is struggling to identify its core customer and is still searching for a new chief executive, all issues that analysts say could push it into bankruptcy if it can’t turn things around quickly.

Penney’s second-quarter earnings report last week delivered the latest in a string of disappointing numbers, sending shares down almost 27% in their biggest one-day tumble in J.C. Penney’s 40-year history as a public company. The day ended with the stock at its lowest level on record. The stock, in fact, has fallen more than 51% in the past year, vastly underperforming the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -1.10% , which has gained 34%, and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.08% , which has gained 17%.

The results and lowered guidance prompted S&P Global Ratings to downgrade the company’s credit rating to B- from B, sending it deeper into speculative-grade, or “junk,” territory. The downgrade reflects “continued weak operating results, compounded by persistently ineffective inventory management that has been a primary contributor to margin pressure and, in our view, indicates increasing execution risk,” said S&P.

StockTwits co-founder Howard Lindzon and MarketWisdom.com co-founder Ivaylo Ivanov this week compared J.C. Penney to another troubled retailer that many are expecting to collapse. The two investors said the “retail sector is the clear leader right now,” with lots of earnings beats and upbeat guidance — but not everyone is benefiting.

“Retail really is dead if you’re J.C. Penney, if you’re Sears,” Lindzon said.

From the MarketWatch archives: Yes, Sears is likely to collapse, but Eddie Lampert will be just fine

The comparison seems apt, looking at Penney’s stock price, which is hovering around $1.80, not too far from Sear’s stock price of $1.13. (Its market capitalization of some $570 million as of Friday afternoon, however, is nearly five times Sears’s.)

‘[T]he company has changed direction several times — first trying to attract younger shoppers, then younger moms, and now back to older shoppers. In our view, this flailing around is a symptom of a wider problem in that J.C. Penney no longer has a sense of what it wants to be and who it wants to serve.’ Neil Saunders, GlobalData Retail

J.C. Penney has failed to zero in on its customer base over the past few years, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Davis conceded on the company’s recent earnings call, and the business is hurting because of it.

In its most recent quarter, the company had to discount slow-moving and excess seasonal inventory to prepare for the back-to-school season. J.C. Penney expects to reduce its enterprise inventory by at least $250 million by the end of fiscal 2019.

Davis said the company “believes” that its core customer is a woman aged 44 to 55-plus and said it is “shifting our philosophy from buying to store capacity to buying and chasing into demonstrated sales trends,” according to a FactSet transcript.

But Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said J.C. Penney has simply lost its way.

“[T]he company has changed direction several times — first trying to attract younger shoppers, then younger moms, and now back to older shoppers,” he wrote. “In our view, this flailing around is a symptom of a wider problem in that J.C. Penney no longer has a sense of what it wants to be and who it wants to serve.”

By the numbers

That lack of focus is compounded by J.C. Penney’s deteriorating financial situation and efforts to reduce a long-term debt load that stood at more than $4 billion in May, when the company filed its annual 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Research firm CreditSights is expecting the company’s fiscal 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to come to $645 million, which would no longer be free-cash-flow positive, assuming full-year capital expenditures of $400 million and interest costs of about $300 million.

“This, of course, reduces the organic opportunities for debt reduction — which was one of the actions we appreciated previously in the J.C. Penney story,” CreditSights analysts James Goldstein and Jesse Wasily wrote in a post-earnings commentary.

J.C. Penney has taken action to raise cash. It sold a fleet of corporate jets, a Connecticut distribution center and an interest in a California mall. But its strategy for 2019 is unclear, it still has no CEO, and the interim “office of the CEO” members are scrambling to take the chain back to its perceived customer base. The fast-fashion strategy that CFO Davis introduced may not be the best next step.

“[F]ast fashion seems to have lost momentum in the U.S. market — if H&M is any indication,” the analysts said, as they downgraded the company’s bonds to hold from outperform.

“We’re not convinced the story is over for J.C. Penney given decent liquidity, a lack of aggressive cash burn, and relatively minor near -term maturities (just $50 [million] in 2019), but we think it is appropriate to take some risk off the table and scale our recommendation,” they said.

CreditRiskMonitor, a risk-analysis group, includes J.C. Penney on a list of retail companies at high risk of bankruptcy. “Overall, we remain somber about J.C. Penney,” said Saunders from GlobalData Retail. “The company just feels increasingly tired and lacking in spirit.”

Tracing past missteps

Some of J.C. Penney’s current challenges can be traced to missteps in the past, not least by Ron Johnson, the Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.26% veteran who joined the company as its top executive in November 2011 and was ousted a year and a half later, having lost $1 billion.

“It’s an unmitigated disaster,” said Hedgeye analyst Brian McGough, when Johnson’s departure was announced.

One of the major changes Johnson made was to eliminate J.C. Penney’s coupons, which were a customer favorite.

“They made some significant bets in terms of how to reposition the business that ultimately proved not to resonate with the consumer,” said Christina Boni, vice president at Moody’s. “The reduction of promotions particularly in the customer’s mind was a difficult adjustment to make.”

Boni said she would like to see J.C. Penney reposition itself in a way that resembles its pre-Johnson setup, but acknowledged that once a customer has walked away, it’s hard to get him or her to return.

“Marvin Ellison made some significant strides getting the company back on track, getting the company some stability, deleveraging it, she said, referring to J.C. Penney’s previous CEO, who has since moved on to the leadership position at the home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos. LOW, -0.40% , leaving the vacancy at the top. “That’s clearly reflected in our B2 stable rating versus the previous distressed level.”

Ronald Tysoe, chairman of the J.C. Penney board, said in the company’s recent earnings release that the Penney has met “highly qualified candidates” who are strongly interested in taking the role. Finding a new CEO is the top priority of the board, he said, “and we will continue to expedite the process in order to bring this search to a successful conclusion.”

In the meantime, other retailers are working to keep up with changing consumer habits, making expensive digital upgrades to accommodate multiplatform shopping, investing to create an entertaining and engaging in-store shopping experience, and curating merchandise to reach a target customer who will become a loyal customer.

And they’re showing positive results from their efforts to keep up with the shift to e-commerce.

Target shares TGT, -0.09% are up 4.4% this week after the company reported upbeat earnings and raised its guidance. Walmart Inc. shares WMT, -0.04% gained more than 9% after it beat sales, earnings and same-store sales expectations. Nordstrom Inc. JWN, -2.71% was up more than 13% the day after that relatively upmarket department-store retailer beat expectations, showing strength in e-commerce.

And though shares of Macy’s Inc. M, -3.07% were down 16% after the company reported earnings that beat expectations and raised guidance, its shares have rallied more than 77% in the past 12 months.

Read: Retailers are hot again — here are the earnings and sales winners

“After a period of protracted performance, department stores have been resurfacing with a leaner, more refined focus,” wrote Moody’s in a note. “The goal is to take the friction out of shopping for a growing base of demanding customers spoiled for shopping choices.”

So far, the new strategies are paying off.

“Many are still in transition, but early indications are that the big competitors are making important progress,” Moody’s said.

J.C. Penney is a few steps behind.

“It’s an old, tired department store that hasn’t really reinvented itself,” said Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester.

J.C. Penney, founded in April 1902, has more than 860 stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, along with an e-commerce site. It closed 141 stores in fiscal 2017.

“It’s a big business, and that means you have to do more to change things,” said Kodali.

J.C. Penney has tried a variety of things, including building out its Sephora shops and expanding in the appliance and baby categories. Kodali said it need needs to close many of its stores and focus on e-commerce.

“The locations aren’t great,” she said, with many stores in lower-tier malls. “You have this albatross around your neck with all these low-quality locations.”

Therace Risch, J.C. Penney’s chief digital officer, said on the earnings call that the company has pulled back on online sales while it adjusts its assortment.

“The most worrying thing about the results is that if J.C. Penney can’t perk itself up at a time when the retail mood is elevated, it suggests that there are fundamental weaknesses in the company’s position,” said GlobalData’s Saunders.",2018-08-24,Walmart
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/now-would-be-the-time-for-apple-to-buy-tesla-and-kick-musk-out-of-the-drivers-seat-2018-08-27,"The idea of a merger between Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. has been floated for years as a way to get attention.

Now, it may not be so ridiculous.

Elon Musk has put an end to his idea to take Tesla TSLA, -0.81% private, but still has a tough road ahead to meet profitability and production projections, especially as Tesla handles expected investigations and lawsuits stemming from Musk’s ridiculous “funding secured” misadventure. Apple AAPL, +0.40% , meanwhile, has billions in cash to burn, manufacturing prowess, obvious interests in entering the car market and finding new form factors beyond the smartphone — and the pull to tell Musk his services are no longer needed.

For more: Tesla stock walloped after Musk axes go-private plan

Apple has been quietly investing in its own troubled self-driving car project, called Project Titan, according to multiple published reports, and continues to hire engineers from Tesla, a practice Musk once mocked by calling Apple ‘the Tesla graveyard.” Tesla was much more charitable last week when asked about a recent spate of Apple hires from its ranks, however.

Apple does have a lot more money than Tesla, which is running out of cash fast. It also has a chief executive in Tim Cook who knows about dealing with supply chains, mass manufacturing and all the other processes that sound easy when Musk describes them but are nearly impossible when Tesla attempts to perform them.

Musk has led Tesla to a precipice with the Model 3 — if the company can perfect the production process, he promises profitable operations perpetually. However, it is hard to believe anything that Musk says after the three weeks of absolute nonsense he just put investors through, to say nothing of his habit of failing to live up to promises.

On Monday, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster played down the theories that Apple might attempt some sort of deal, saying that if Tesla becomes profitable, the notion is just a fairy tale.

“If we’re wrong, and Tesla fails to reach profitability in the next year, Apple gains the upper hand and becomes the most likely investor or buyer,” Munster wrote in a blog post.

Wall Street has obvious, and warranted doubts, about Tesla turning into a sustainably profitable company under Musk’s watch. Tesla has promised profitability in both quarters of the second half, but the consensus on Wall Street is for Tesla to report a non-GAAP loss of 29 cents a share in the third quarter, and doubts about the sustainability of any profit are legion.

“The verdict is still out on whether Tesla can ultimately deliver 25% normalized gross margins on the Model 3, given that the company has only inconsistently delivered 25% gross margins on its $100K Model S and X offerings, and that high volume luxury competitors (i.e., BMW 3-series) have gross margins of around 30%,” wrote Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a note earlier this month.

Opinion: Ignore the drama at Tesla and focus on the stock’s price zones to make money

Apple knows a little something about building a strong profit margin with a premium product sold through its own retail outlets, and could handle many of the other issues that will continue to beset Musk and Tesla. In his now legendary tearful interview with the New York Times, Musk admitted that Tesla has sought another executive to handle operations, and even said that “anyone who can do a better job” could have the CEO role.

It will be hard, if not impossible, for Tesla and Musk to recruit an executive of that strength. Apple, though, would be a big draw for such executives, especially if it convinced Musk to step aside.

While the deal make sense, there are obviously roadblocks. Apple has never spent more than $3 billion for an acquisition, and even with the recent decline in Tesla stock, the car maker is still worth nearly $55 billion. Musk owns about 20% of the company and wields control over its board, which includes his brother and other close comrades who seem to follow his lead, so he would seemingly have to buy in to the idea.

If Musk would allow such a sale, it could be a way to greatly improve Tesla’s manufacturing with some much-needed cash, and join two companies known for their fanatical customers. But in all likelihood, such a deal will indeed remain a fairy tale.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/charting-the-break-to-clear-skies-territory-sp-500-nasdaq-tag-record-highs-2018-08-28-121032028,"Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have taken flight to conclude August, and potentially consequential breakouts remain underway.

Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has extended its rally to uncharted territory — tagging the 2,900 mark for the first time on record — while the Nasdaq Composite has concurrently reached all-time highs, venturing atop the 8,000 mark.

Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, +0.14% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.

As illustrated, the S&P has cleared the range top, knifing to all-time highs.

Tactically, the breakout point (2,873) pivots to support. Conversely, a near- to intermediate-term target projects to the 2,924 area, detailed previously.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has tagged six-month highs.

The upturn places it atop the 26,000 mark for the first time since February.

Tactically, the former range top (25,888) closely matches the top of the gap (25,882) and pivots to near-term support.

Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.34% has knifed to record territory, also clearing the 8,000 mark for the first time.

A near-term floor matches the top of the gap (7,976) and is followed by the firmer breakout point (7,933), also illustrated below.

Widening the view to six months adds perspective.

On this wider view, the Nasdaq has gapped to uncharted territory, extending its rally from trendline support. Targets project from recent lows to the 8,115, 8,190 and 8,260 areas.

Conversely, first support matches the breakout point (7,933) and is followed by the more important trendline, a level closely tracking the 50-day moving average.

Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has extended its break to six-month highs.

The prevailing upturn originates from a mid-month retest of trendline support and the 50-day moving average.

On further strength, additional overhead matches the January post-breakdown peak (26,338) and the top of the January gap (26,435). Also recall that a technical target projects from the August low to about 26,420.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gapped to record territory.

The prevailing upturn originates from major support (2,802) matching the former breakout point. To reiterate, a near-term target projects to the 2,924 area. (Start with the early-August peak and subtract major support: 2,863 - 2,802 = 61 points. Then, add the result back: 2,863 + 61 = 2,924.)

The bigger picture

As detailed above, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture market backdrop continues to strengthen.

On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have knifed to all-time highs, reaching uncharted territory, capped by no true resistance.

Moreover, the initial selling pressure at record territory has been muted, and when sellers are absent, prices rise to draw sellers.

Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has extended a previously modest break to record territory.

The breakout resolves a double bottom — defined by the June and July lows — and a near- to intermediate-term target projects to the 175.50 area.

Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has knifed more decisively to record territory.

The breakout resolves a bullish ascending triangle, and punctuates a successful test of trendline support. A near-term target projects to the 375 area.

Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has also extended its August rally to record highs. The prevailing upturn punctuates a successful mid-month retest of the breakout point.

Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, the index has gapped to uncharted territory, rising from major support at the mid-August low (2,802).

From current levels, the breakout point marks a well-defined floor (2,873) closely matching the January peak and last week’s close. The initial retest of this area would be expected to draw buyers.

Conversely, the S&P 500’s next target projects from the mid-August low to the 2,924 area, detailed previously.

Much more broadly, the S&P 500 is rising from a jagged, and relatively deep, year-to-date consolidation phase, pinned to the steep 2017 rally. The range spanned 341 points from peak to trough, or about 11.9%.

The prevailing break from this challenging range opens the path to uncharted territory, and potentially meaningful follow-through. Recall that a truly longer-term target projects to the 3,210 area from the 2018 range. (Start with the range top and subtract the 2018 low: 2,873 - 2,532 = 341 points. Then, add back to the breakout point: 2,873 + 341 = 3,214.)

The quality of the prevailing breakout, still underway, will likely add color.

Tuesday’s Watch List

The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.

U.S. sub-sector backdrop strengthens — Charting the traditional sector leaders

Drilling down further, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop has strengthened amid still rotational price action. Quickly consider the traditional sector leaders: The transports, financials and technology sector.

To start, the iShares Transportation Average ETF has reached record highs. The prevailing bull flag is a continuation pattern, underpinned by the breakout point.

More broadly, the upturn punctuates a multi-month continuation pattern — illustrated on the three-year chart — opening the path to potentially material follow-through.

As an economically-sensitive sector, the group’s resurgence strengthens the bull case. (Raw materials are transported to manufacturing facilities amid increased economic activity, and then finished goods are re-transported to points of sale.)

Meanwhile, the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, +0.44% tracks the Nasdaq 100 and offers a large-cap technology proxy.

As illustrated, the group has knifed to all-time highs, clearing resistance matching the July peak.

Tactically, the breakout point (182.90) is followed by trendline support, a level closely tracking the 50-day moving average, currently 178.20. The prevailing uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.

Against this backdrop, the Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF, -0.33% is belatedly coming to life.

Specifically, the group has reached five-month highs, amid a volume uptick, escaping a formerly jagged range. Tactically, the former range top (28.50) is followed by the 200-day moving average (27.95) and the group’s breakout attempt is intact barring a violation.

The financials’ resurgence dovetails with the 10-year Treasury note yield’s stabilization near major support, an area detailed last week.

Participation broadens beyond the sector leaders

Looking elsewhere, sector participation has also broadened beyond the traditional leaders.

As illustrated, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR XLI, -0.08% has reached five-month highs, rising from a modified double bottom defined by the May and June lows.

The breakout punctuates a successful test of the major moving averages, opening the path to a projected target around 80.00. Conversely, the breakout point (77.00) pivots to well-defined support.

Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -1.08% is digesting an August rally to all-time highs.

Tactically, the breakout point pivots to support (51.00) and is followed by the trendline, a level roughly tracking the 50-day moving average, currently 50.20. The group’s uptrend is intact barring a violation.

Beyond the U.S., the iShares Emerging Markets ETF EEM, -0.07% is showing signs of life technically.

Specifically, the shares have rallied from 13-month lows, edging atop trendline resistance on increased volume.

On further strength, major resistance matches the breakdown point (45.10). A close higher would mark a “higher high” more firmly signaling a trend shift.

Conversely, trendline support closely tracks the 50-day moving average, currently 43.55. The prevailing recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-bulls-are-in-firm-control-but-heres-where-vulnerabilities-kick-in-2018-08-28,"It’s looking lovely for the stock market’s true believers at the moment, as the Nasdaq gets acquainted with the 8,000 level, while the Dow says “nice to see you again” to 26,000.

“The bulls have firm control here, as a market breaking out of prior all-time highs is as bullish as it gets,” says Chris Weston, Pepperstone Group’s head of research.

“Sure, the bears can focus on valuation and fairly concentrated breadth,” he adds. However, Weston suggests he’s not worrying about the market’s pricey-ness yet — and then he gives the spot where he expects to see more trouble.

“The S&P 500 on 16.8X consensus forward earnings is lofty, but there is scope for the market to push this to 18X before real vulnerabilities kick in,” he writes, delivering our call of the day.

“So I am happy to remain long here, with conviction increased on a weekly close through 2,872, while ideally, one would want to see new highs in the Dow and Dow transport index, too.”

Strategist Ed Yardeni also notes the S&P 500 is trading at just below 17 times forward-year estimated earnings. And Yardeni is pushing back against talk that the market’s breadth stinks, pointing out that it’s not just all about FAANGs, as small caps and mid caps are performing well, too.

Meanwhile, Jeremy “Stocks for the Long Run” Siegel has been emphasizing that “we are much less, so to speak, overvalued” than just before the dot-com bubble popped in 2000. “It feels like pretty reasonable valuation,” the professor said to CNBC, highlighting that the S&P changed hands 18 years ago at about 30 times trailing earnings.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-stock-falls-as-analysts-fret-it-could-go-the-way-of-gopro-or-fitbit-2018-08-27,"Sonos Inc.’s loyal customer base, premium products, and platform-neutral ecosystem may not be enough to help the company withstand the competitive landscape for smart speakers, some analysts argue.

At least three analysts initiated coverage of Sonos’ stock SONO, -0.47% with hold ratings on Monday, citing competition from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.49% Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.38% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.06% and others, as well as the company’s current valuation. Three more analysts started coverage with buy ratings.

In question is whether Sonos can avoid the fate of Fitbit Inc. FIT, -2.24% and GoPro Inc. GPRO, +0.40% two hardware companies that have seen their stocks plummet since their hot initial public offerings.

Don’t miss: Why Sonos thinks its hardware IPO will be different

Sonos shares were down 4.7% in midday trading, though they’d been indicating higher premarket.

Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who began coverage with a hold rating and a $23 price target, is concerned about the company’s growth profile. He sees “no high-growth revenue catalyst on the horizon,” though he noted that the company plans to start releasing two new products a year for the first time in an attempt to jolt growth.

Thill also discussed the competitive environment for smart speakers, writing that companies like Google and Amazon can afford to subsidize smart speakers to help their voice assistants gain acceptance. Sonos, on the other hand, focuses on higher-end products.

“While the experience is premium, the higher price point of Sonos’ products makes it a difficult hurdle for consumers in the low-mid tier range (compared to low priced speakers like Amazon’s Echo for $99 or Echo dot for $50),” Thill commented.

See also: 5 things to know about the maker of high-end speakers

Stifel analyst Matthew Sheerin views Sonos’ high-end positioning as a positive, though he still worries about “competition coming from all sides.” Amazon and Google now have more expensive models that are more in line with what Sonos offers, and other audio-focused companies are getting more serious about smart speakers.

“Despite that competition, we still see Sonos with a competitive edge due to its ‘sticky’ relationship with its large and loyal installed base, which should drive refreshes and add-on products; and Sonos’ ‘platform agnostic’ position with regard to third-party streaming services,” Sheerin wrote. He also said that the company’s path to profitability could be difficult and deems the stock fairly priced around current levels.

Sheerin has a hold rating and $20 price target on the stock, which recently changed hands at $19.22.

Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, who began coverage with an equal-weight rating and $20 price target, said that the company’s new product launches will determine whether it avoids the fate of Fitbit and GoPro.

“If new products fail to meet expectations, we think the multiple will contract similar to Fitbit and GoPro after their initial product missteps,” Huberty wrote. (That equates to about one times revenue, or $7, per Morgan Stanley’s “bear case” valuation scenario.) She argued that the stock could trade more in line with shares of Logitech International SA LOGI, +0.24% and Garmin Inc. GRMN, +0.89% if its new products outperform expectations. That could mean a multiple of about three times revenue, which gives Huberty a $34 “bull case” valuation.

Huberty said she remains sidelined until she sees whether new items like the Beam, a sound bar, can exceed expectations.

Other analysts were more positive. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $25 price target, writing of his expectation for double-digit growth over the long run. The company is at the “unique intersection” of streaming music, Wi-Fi penetration, and voice assistants, all of which are technologies that should see increased usage over the next few years.

Daryanani doubts that the company will become the next Fitbit or GoPro because user engagement trends look strong; nearly half of registered households use the Sonos app daily. “Fitbit and GoPro had a strong initial surge of popularity but that user engagement for the devices likely declined after purchase.”

Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall is also bullish on the stock, beginning coverage at buy with a $25 price target.

“We believe Sonos’ increased product cadence will improve customer engagement in reaching beyond the company’s loyal customer base and we expect frequent product launches to help drive more consistent revenue growth,” Hall wrote. “Sonos also possesses what we see as valuable multiroom music streaming intellectual property that should be monetizeable over time.”

The company’s IP portfolio could enable it to bring multiple voice assistants into a single product, what Hall would deem to be a “unique ability.”

Raymond James analyst Adam Tindle, meanwhile, is upbeat about the company’s potential to expand into the portable-speaker market. “We see portable speakers as a natural extension into a total addressable market that should be north of $5 billion, and a product that would be additive to systems,” he wrote. “Beyond this areas such as headphones, and perhaps eventually automobiles, provide further growth vectors over time.”

Tindle has an outperform rating and $24 price target on the shares, which are up about 28% from their IPO price of $15.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/interview-with-amds-su-on-change-in-foundry-its-roadmap-and-new-head-of-client-compute-business-2018-08-28,"Advanced Micro Devices faces two issues that at first glance appear as risks.

A partner that AMD AMD, -3.53% was working with on its transition to 7-nanometer (nm) technology announced Monday that it would no longer be pursuing so-called “leading edge” silicon manufacturing. As a result, AMD must now depend on a single production source, the same one used by Nvidia NVDA, +0.79% Apple AAPL, +0.37% and Qualcomm QCOM, -0.42%

Also, the company said Senior Vice President Jim Anderson, previously responsible for overseeing the entirety of the client-compute business, would be departing for a career move to Lattice Semiconductor LSCC, +3.69%

I spoke with CEO Lisa Su Monday afternoon about both of those items, and it appears all is still well at AMD. In fact, things may pan out better in the long term as a result of the changes.

Move to 7 nanometers

The move to 7-nm process technology is a big one for AMD. The company bet heavily on this transition and its ability to give the company a leadership position over Intel INTC, -0.14% and performance parity with GPU-rival Nvidia. Until Monday, plans for 7-nm product releases used both TSMC and GlobalFoundries. But GlobalFoundries announced Monday afternoon that it was putting its research and engineering of 7 nm on “indefinite hold” as it instead refocused on its current production capabilities. There is another story on that angle I will touch on in a future story.

For AMD, this has several side effects. The negatives include a reduction in potential silicon-production capacity: Having two facilities building 7-nm chips for CPUs and graphics means higher throughput. Not only that but pitting TSMC against GlobalFoundries created an opportunity for AMD to select the best process technology for the best designs, matching the proficiencies of one fab to one chip. And, of course, there would be the cost advantages of having a dual source option, bidding and other issues.

But in reality, this move can focus AMD, making it stronger and more prepared for the dramatic technological changes that come with 7 nm. Rather than spending engineering time and talent on developing chips on competing process nodes (you cannot simply take a design built for TSMC and move it to another foundry, for example), AMD now knows that all of its leading-edge products will be built with the Taiwanese foundry. This saves money in R&D and allows the teams to be diligent with design characteristics.

We already knew through well-timed leaks that the first 7-nm graphics chip and the first 7-nm server processor were going to be built with TSMC, leading those of us who follow the field closely to understand who the leader in the clubhouse was in terms of design readiness and executive confidence inside AMD.

Su acknowledged that was the case. As it relates to AMD, there will be no impact on roadmaps, product release schedules or customer commitments. If that seems nearly impossible considering the company lost one of only two possible sources for 7-nm production, Su said this was a “testament to the work done [by AMD] to ensure access to leading-edge technologies.” Basically, AMD was smart to hold positions with both silicon providers.

AMD’s relationship with GlobalFoundries won’t disappear. It is still building the current crop of processors based on 14 nm and 12 nm, and Su said that will continue for the foreseeable future. When I asked if we might see some new products built for 14/12nm rather than the 7-nm technology for some markets that don’t need the pinnacle of performance, I only got a “maybe” response. “Malta [the location of GlobalFoundries 14/12-nm fab] will remain a large part of our volume,” Su said.

Competing for production space

Now that AMD will need to compete with the likes of Nvida, Qualcomm and even Apple for access to the 7-nm product lines at TSMC, might AMD get squeezed on inventory? There might be some concern, but despite AMD being a smaller player than Nvidia and Apple, it already does significant work with TSMC on semi-custom designs that wind up in the Microsoft MSFT, +0.84% Xbox or Sony PlayStation.

AMD is also one of the earliest players with the biggest drive to get 7 nm out early, making the company a great target for TSMC to utilize to help the process develop. TSMC would love nothing more than to get out from under the shadow of the waxing-and-waning smartphone and tablet space, and partnering with AMD allows the foundry to expand its own addressable market and improve its production diversity.

In the end, Su told me that the move from GlobalFoundries to halt 7-nm development “is not a bad thing” for AMD. It allows the company to simplify IP development, refocus resources, all without changing the roadmap or affecting the future execution milestones that AMD’s recent stock surge has been built on.

Leadership change

The announcement that Jim Anderson would be stepping down as the SVP of the client-compute group came as a bit of a surprise to me. Anderson has been at the helm during the rebirth of the AMD and Ryzen brands for mobile, desktop and workstation markets, so it’s hard to not see this as a loss for the company. Anderson is taking up the CEO role at Lattice Semi, a U.S.-based company that builds programmable logic devices, most recently in the news for having a Chinese purchase blocked by President Trump.

AMD’s Su called the move part of a “normal career progression” and said she was supportive of the transition for Anderson.

Anderson’s replacement, Saeid Moshkelani, has been working under and reporting to him since early in the year, setting up a contingency for something like this. Moshkelani previously led the company’s semi-custom business and was responsible for growing it from nothing to a multi-billion-dollar business.

Su admitted that the competitive landscape for talent in this field was tough. She said AMD has a “very strong bench” and that the company purposefully grooms talent for senior positions.

When asked if there were any changes coming for the Ryzen brand or product lines with the leadership adjustment, Su said no. “There is no change in the roadmap. We are very bullish on Ryzen moving forward,” she told me.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/watch-for-bitcoin-to-move-explosively-higher-when-this-market-signal-flashes-2018-08-27,"If the Lambo-lovin’ faithful across the internet are any indication, bitcoin “hodlers” have been surprisingly patient during this nightmarish year. As you can see from this Reddit post, they’ve also kept their sense of humor:

Maybe it’s because they’re confident in the long-term story. Or perhaps they got in early enough that the latest batch of weakness doesn't even matter.

Whatever the case may be, bitcoin investors are about to get paid in big way, according to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who told CNBC in a recent interview that the signal for an imminent rally will come from emerging markets. Specifically, when the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF EEM, -0.25% starts to rebound, he says, watch for bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.18% to do the same.

A relationship between the two struggling investments — the emerging-markets ETF is off about 8% so far this year, while bitcoin has obviously been hit MUCH harder — has been forming of late. Lee says the correlation illustrated in this graphic could be key in predicting a reversal for bitcoin:

“Both really essentially peaked early this year, and they both have been in a downward trend,” Lee said. “Until emerging markets begin to turn, I think in some ways that correlation is going to hold and tell us that sort of the risk on mentality is those buyers aren’t buying bitcoin.”

He explained that hedge funds avoid buying risk when there’s trouble in emerging markets. And when they aren’t buying risk, they’re surely not buying bitcoin. But when that appetite for risk returns, Lee, in our call of the day, believes it’ll be enough to carry bitcoin to $25,000. This year.

If the dollar weakens and the Fed taps the brakes on its rate-hike policy, Lee predicts the firepower that’s been waiting on the sidelines will jump in.

“I still think it’s possible,” said Lee. “Bitcoin could end the year explosively higher.”

Watch the interview:

As for today’s market action, stocks are, again, looking very strong as we wind down August, which is normally a miserable month for equities. Clearly, that hasn’t been the case this time around.

The market

The Dow DJIA, -0.04% is up more than 200 points, while the Nasdaq COMP, +0.28% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.10% are also adding to Friday’s record highs. Gold GCU8, -0.37% is edging higher. Crude oil CLV8, +0.86% is showing a rare splash of red. Bitcoin is a long ways away from that bold $25,000 prediction but it’s up modestly to $6,693.

Overseas, Asia markets ADOW, +0.34% gained, boosted by the People’s Bank of China’s move to shore up its currency in what could be an olive branch to President Trump, while much of Europe SXXP, +0.03% is enjoying some upside. The U.K. market is closed for a holiday.

The buzz

Time to start guessing what new Apple AAPL, +0.53% products we’ll see in September. More iPhone Xs? A new high-end phone will have a display that measures about 6.5 inches diagonally, according to Bloomberg. And while Apple keeps finding ways to get customers to pay more, it’s also planning a new, lower-end device. No word yet on the price tag.

Meanwhile, Slate says Mac fans could finally get an update worth having.

The chart

Last week, the New York Times ran a piece entitled, “End stock buybacks, save the economy.” The idea being that the U.S. economy is on the ropes because of inequality, unstable employment and weak productivity. Eliminating stock buybacks would take care of all that, according to the article.

To all that, Cullen Roche of the Pragmatic Capitalism blog says, “So. Much. Hyperbole.” He said the authors are “misleading at best and very wrong at worst” and the “argument against buybacks is basically one big fallacy of composition.”

As the chart shows, companies that buy back their own shares tend to outperform those that don’t. And it follows, Roche explains, that companies buying back shares contribute more to aggregate household net worth than those that don’t.

Furthermore, does the economy really need saving at this point?

“As if the U.S. economy is on the brink of death with its record-setting GDP and low unemployment,” he wrote. “I fully admit that inequality is a big issue and I think that it makes our economy operate below its potential, but we don’t need to go overboard trying to stoke populist rage with these falsehoods about how healthy the U.S. economy.”

Roche acknowledges inequality is a problem and should be addressed before mounting public outrage turns into a populist nightmare. “It sure would be swell if corporations took all of their profits and just gave them over to their employees,” he wrote. “But that’s not how capitalism works.”

The stat

44% — That’s President Trump’s latest job approval rating, which barely budged after Paul Manafort was convicted on fraud charges and Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to tax fraud and campaign finance violations.

Getty Images These poll numbers are reason to smile.

Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said the results were a challenge to Trump adversaries who were hoping for more backlash from the legal blows. “For the 2018 Democratic strategy, the Manafort and Cohen convictions represent a fool’s gold opportunity rather than a silver bullet solution,” Hart said.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-dethrones-amazon-in-investor-money-flows-2018-08-24,"A major shift is happening in a popular U.S. technology stock.

Let us explore with the help of a chart.

Chart

Please click here for the chart showing segmented money flows, risk-adjusted rankings and non-risk-adjusted rankings of 11 popular tech stocks. Please note the following from the chart:

• For a long time Amazon AMZN, +1.51% has been the king, always getting a non-risk-adjusted ranking of number one. Now the king has been overthrown. The new king is AMD AMD, -3.63% AMD’s stock has surged about 120% this year. Amazon’s shares are up by about half that amount.

The rankings shown on the chart are based on the six screens of ZYX Change Method. The premise behind the ZYX Change Method is that most money is made with the lowest risk by successfully predicting changes before the crowd notices.

• The common element among all stocks is that money is fungible. An investor deciding to invest new money in stocks today can freely pick AMD, Amazon or any other stock. An investor looking at the non-risk-adjusted ranking would pick AMD over Amazon.

• Non-risk-adjusted rankings are useful for the short term. Risk-adjusted rankings are useful for the long term.

• In the big picture, AMD, Nvidia NVDA, +0.75% and Intel INTC, -0.14% are in the same business. It was not that long ago that Nvidia’s stock was trading in the $20 range. Now it is trading around $250. And now AMD’s stock is trading in the $20 range; can it become a so-called 10-bagger? Once upon a time Intel also provided huge gains, but many investors probably don’t remember because it was such a long time ago.

• AMD is undergoing a short squeeze. A total of 23.04% of the float is short. Under the short squeeze column in the chart, AMD has been rated extremely positive. Now that call is coming true. Many investors have believed that the rise in AMD stock was not justified. For this reason they sold AMD stock short, betting on a decline. In a short squeeze, short-sellers panic and buy to cover shares they previously sold short. Right now, short-sellers in AMD are in a panic, pushing the stock higher.

• Momo (momentum) crowd money flows are extremely positive in AMD. They are also extremely positive in Apple and Amazon.

• Smart money flows are only mildly positive in AMD. This is a note of caution.

• The chart shows that the short squeeze potential for Tesla TSLA, -0.62% is very positive.

• The short squeeze potential for Apple AAPL, +0.36% Google GOOG, +0.95% GOOGL, +1.07% and Microsoft MSFT, +0.83% is negative.

• The chart shows that the short squeeze potential for Facebook FB, -0.26% Amazon, Netflix NFLX, -1.25% Alibaba BABA, -0.48% Intel and Nvidia is positive. Often a short squeeze is the trigger for the initial rise in a stock, and then the momo crowd takes over.

Fundamentals

In the long term, fundamentals drive stocks. If you could consider only one fundamental factor, it is earnings growth. The problem with traditional fundamental analysis is that everybody has more or less the same information. For this reason, traditional fundamental ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) do not provide an edge. For investors who are looking for an edge, the data shown on the chart provides just that.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gala-apple-is-about-to-knock-off-red-delicious-as-americas-favorite-to-grow-2018-08-27,"The Red Delicious will lose its reign as the most popular apple grown in the U.S. this year after more than half a century at No. 1.

The U.S. Apple Association, which advocates on behalf of 7,500 apple growers and 400 companies in the apple business, is projecting that the Gala apple will take over, as consumers prefer its “taste, texture and sweetness.” Gala already is the most popular variety sold in the U.S., followed by Red Delicious, according to the association.

In response to shifting preference, the U.S. will grow 52.4 million units of Gala apples in 2018, up 5.9% from a year earlier. Gala originated in New Zealand in the 1930s. One unit is 42 pounds of apples.

Red Delicious production, meanwhile, is expected to tumble 10.7% to 51.7 million units in 2018, the trade group predicts. Red Delicious will still account for about half of U.S. apple exports.

The Granny Smith, Fuji and Honeycrisp apples are expected to rank third, fourth and fifth, respectively, in U.S. production.

The Honeycrisp, created at the University of Minnesota only roughly two decades ago, is surging in popularity. Its production is up 21.8% to 23.5 million units this year. That puts it ahead of the Golden Delicious apple for the first time.

The association predicted that “within a year or two.” the Honeycrisp may pass the Granny Smith and Fuji in popularity.

U.S. Apple Association Chair Mark Boyer told the group’s 2018 Crop Outlook and Marketing conference last week that this has “been one of the most challenging and unusual years in the 123-year history” of the group, in large part because of the tariff climate initiated by President Trump.

Apple growers export about $1 billion worth of apples annually, roughly one-third of the country’s crop.

“The White House has taken actions to restrict trade with Mexico, India and China—our first, second and sixth-largest export markets,” Boyer, an apple grower in Pennsylvania, told conference attendees. “That has us all unsettled as we kick off the new harvest.”

As part of its retaliation, China, for example, has slapped a 15% tariff on U.S. apples. Trump has said U.S. producers of many crops may feel near-term pain as his administration wants to shift the U.S. global trade position.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/september-is-a-great-time-to-get-deals-on-these-items-2018-08-27,"Before you embark on fall shopping, consult our guide on what you should buy (and skip) in the month of September.

Buy: Mattresses

In the days leading up to Labor Day on Sept. 3, you’ll see significant discounts on mattresses, which is ideal given that you’ll have plenty of time to test out the various models over the long weekend.

Last year, Bear Mattress offered an online coupon code for $100 off any size Bear mattress. Mattress Firm gave away a free adjustable base with select purchases of $1,299.99 and above. J.C. Penney marked down mattresses and bedding.

While you’re scoping out Labor Day mattress sales, visit the rest of the home department. Furniture and appliances will also be discounted over the holiday weekend.

Skip: TVs

There are a few excellent times to buy a TV. One is in late November when Black Friday deals begin to roll out (last year Best Buy BBY, -0.12% had a 50-inch Sharp SHCAY, -1.23% LED smart 4K Ultra HDTV in-store for $179.99), and another is in late January or early February, ahead of the Super Bowl. Because of this, we suggest waiting to do your TV shopping for a few more months to maximize your savings.

Buy: iPhones

It’s rumored that Apple AAPL, +0.36% plans to announce new iPhones in September, which means two things. First, there will be new technology on the market, so if you like the latest and greatest, hold off on buying until then. Second, retailers will likely discount last year’s models. If you’re still using an older version of the phone, this might be the perfect month to upgrade to last year’s model.

If the savings are anything like in the past, Apple will reduce the subsidized cost of the older phone by $100. Shortly thereafter, it’s likely that other retailers such as Best Buy and Target TGT, +0.23% will offer their own deals.

Skip: Halloween costumes

It’s that time of year when retailers pull out holiday displays way too early. In September, stores are already pushing Halloween costumes, fall décor and all things pumpkin spice.

If you can resist the temptation, your best bet on savings is to shop for seasonal decorations and candy after Halloween is over, so if you can wear last year’s costume again this year, go that route. If you don’t want to reuse, wait for Halloween sales in October.

Buy: Plane tickets

Don’t limit yourself to items you can place in a shopping cart: There are plenty of other areas where you can save money, including holiday airfare.

According to the Holiday Cheap Flights Report 2018 from online travel agency CheapAir.com, fares for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s flights are expected to increase in October, November and December. If you can book now before they do, go for it.

Bonus: Coffee

Sept. 29 is National Coffee Day. Play it right and you can treat yourself to your favorite cup of joe free in honor of the caffeine-centric day. Check for this year’s deals on social media.

Looking ahead: Columbus Day

If you miss out on Labor Day sales, you’ll still have a shot at discounted clothing, home décor and appliances. Oct. 8 is Columbus Day, and department stores use the holiday as yet another reason to offer sales.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fortnite-android-app-had-a-major-security-flaw-and-google-found-it-2018-08-25,"Days after “Fortnite” said it would launch an Android app but circumvent Alphabet Inc.’s app store, Google found a major security flaw in the Android version of the game and publicly exposed both the flaw and a request to keep it quiet.

The flaw has since been repaired by Tencent Holdings Inc. TCEHY, -1.47% -backed Epic Games Inc., which asked Alphabet GOOGL, +1.00% GOOG, +0.92% not to disclose the information for 90 days. Google engineers refused and published the details of the exploit Friday — a week later — as well as the exchange with Epic’s developers.

When app makers circumvent the Alphabet-owned Google Play Store — or Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.27% similar app store — they avoid paying a 30% fee on sales made through their apps, but they do not receive some services included in the fee. “Fortnite” is the most high-profile instance of a developer publicly avoiding the Play Store while launching an Android app, but Friday’s security disclosure is now the most high-profile demonstration of the risks associated with that strategy.

AndroidCentral first reported the news late Friday.

Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney has praised open platforms like Android and even said he doesn’t take issue with digital stores for console games. But Google’s control over Android is another story, he has said, because he believes Google isn’t making the same amount of effort to market titles to consumers: So if Epic can avoid it, why not do so?

Don’t miss: How ‘Fortnite’ cracked the code to become the most successful free videogame ever

Instead of offering the app in Google’s Play Store, Epic offered it only as a direct download from the internet. After it was publicly posted on Aug. 9, Google researchers tested it and found the flaw, a serious one that would let any app on an Android phone download and run software without a user knowing.

Epic fixed the bug about a day after learning about it, or six days after “Fornite” officially launched on Android. Users who downloaded the installer for “Fortnite” have likely already received an automatic fix Epic rolled out, but it’s unclear how many people downloaded the flawed Android app or if hackers had made use of the exploit. The Google security team also included a proof-of-concept video demonstrating how people could exploit the bug.

“Fortnite” may need the Android app to re-energize the hugely lucrative free-to-play game. “Fortnite” sales grew at a slower rate in July compared to the prior month, according to research published this week by SuperData, despite the launch of a new season. The free-to-play battle royale game became an outsize success in recent months, and has raked in millions of dollars a month on cosmetic upgrades and subscription sales.

Google and Epic did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Friday afternoon.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-the-latest-company-to-try-bypassing-apples-app-store-2018-08-23,"Netflix is joining the likes of Epic Games Inc. and Spotify Technology SA SPOT, -0.63% in its latest move: testing a way for users to register and pay for the streaming service while bypassing Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.41% app store and hefty commission fees.

The streaming giant is the latest company to look into bypassing Apple's app store and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +0.97% Google Play. Both Apple and Google take a 30% commission on all apps and in-app purchases, and the commission drops to 15% after the first year.

Netflix NFLX, -1.28% is looking into a new sign-up approach where users in some countries are no longer able to register for streaming service. They are being redirected to the mobile web version of the app and asked to enter payment details with Netflix directly. The test is running in 33 countries, not including the U.S., through the month of September, according to TechCrunch. This comes just months after Netflix in May made billing through Google Pay unavailable to new customers, though current subscribers that pay via Google Play can continue to do so until they cancel their accounts.

Don’t miss: Netflix is testing ‘video promos’ between episodes and users are not happy

Companies have long complained about the heavy cut Apple and Google take in return for visibility on their platforms. Spotify does not allow new subscribers to sign up via Apple’s app store, though the app itself can still be downloaded there. The company has been especially vocal about the fees over the years, publicly speaking out and approaching U.S. and European regulators about the issue. In 2015, Spotify sent emails to its iPhone customers, urging them to pay through Spotify.com rather than through Apple’s store. “If you switch your payments to Spotify.com, there are no transaction costs and you’ll save money,” said the emails, which included step-by-step instructions on how to shut off auto-renew in iTunes and how to re-subscribe on the Spotify website. The emails said the monthly fees through Spotify.com would be $9.99 versus $12.99 through the app store.

And e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.48% does not give Apple a cut of Kindle books purchased; for years, users have had to buy them through the Amazon website, not through the Kindle app.

Video game makers are pushing back, as well.

“We’ve had behind-closed-door discussions with game developers who claim that Apple and Google’s commission structure is unfair and that they may take a more public role in pushing back against the business model,” wrote Macquarie analysts, led by Ben Schachter, in a note last week.

Epic Games will be launching its hit game Fortnite for Android on its own website, and fans will only be able to download the game there, not on Google Play. Fortnite is available on Apple’s app store; Apple does not allow any third-party apps to be installed on its devices, while the setting that blocks third-party installations can be disabled on Android phones.

The pushback from companies may mean the longstanding app distribution model, as dictated by Apple and Google, needs to change, said Schachter in his note.

“We believe that the scale of the global app market and its growing importance to the platforms and the millions of app developers and publishers may lead to changes to the model,” he wrote.

Netflix shares have shot up 77% so far this year, while shares of Apple have surged up 27% and shares of Alphabet have gained 16%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% has gained 7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq COMP, +0.34% has gained 14%.",2018-08-23,Google
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-what-happens-when-you-take-phones-away-from-teenagers-2018-08-22,"Teens are trying to put their phones down.

More than half of teens are worried they spend too much time on mobile devices and are making efforts to stop, according to a Pew Research Center report released Wednesday. The survey of 743 U.S. teens found that teenagers sometimes react strongly when their phone is taken away. Roughly four-in-ten teenagers said they feel anxious when they leave home without their cell phone and more than half (56%) associate the absence of their cell phone with at least one of these three emotions: loneliness, being upset or feeling anxious.

More worrying perhaps, these feelings are similar to those associated with withdrawal from addictive behavior. Addiction specialists say teenagers suffering from depression or anxiety often use smartphones as a coping mechanism rather than learning to sit with their emotions and developing relationships. That can create a Catch-22 when they seek solace from the same device that prevents them from processing their emotions.

Heavy smartphone users can’t go 10 minutes without their phone before suffering from anxiety, according to a 2014 study published in the journal “Computers in Human Behavior” and coauthored by Larry Rosen, professor of psychology at California State University and author of “iDisorder: Understanding Our Obsession with Technology and Overcoming Its Hold on Us.” Rosen says most people can’t go an hour without getting anxious if their smartphone is taken away.

Parents are also feeling anxious, but for different reasons. Some 65% of parents of teens are worried their child is spending too much time in front of screens and 57% have set restrictions, Pew found. But teenagers say they’re trying to cut back. Some 52% of teens say they are cutting back on phone use, including limiting time on social media (57%) and video games (58%).

Smartphones are shortening attention spans in young people

Recent studies have shed light on the negative effects social media and nearly constant phone use is having on teens. The average 12th grader now spends six hours a day online, including two hours on social media, two hours surfing the internet, and two hours texting, a study published this month in the journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture found.This is likely having an adverse effect on the attention spans of young people, Jean Twenge, author of that study and professor of psychology at San Diego State University, said.

It could also be causing broader cultural shifts, including teens taking more time to accomplish “adult” milestones like sex, drinking, and working a job for the first time. The number of teenagers who tried alcohol between 2010 and 2016 dropped to 67%, down from 93% for teenagers between 1976 and 1979. The number of teens who had engaged in sexual activity by the end of high school also dropped by 12% between 1994 and 2016.

“Using digital media often involves very quick switching between tasks, often every few seconds, at the most every few minutes,” Twenge said. Reading books and magazine articles requires more sustained attention. Thus young people may be getting less practice at media activities that involve sustained attention.”

Establishing “no-technology zones,” like banning phones at dinner or at bedtime are “crucial” for teens, Michael Burns, co-founder of Zift, a platform that provides data and tools to parents seeking to limit screen time for their children, said. “Help your teen understand the risks and potential harm that overexposure to technology can have,” he said. “Their environment influences their development and if our teen’s environment is primarily technology driven, it can impact them both cognitively and socially.”

More consumers are attempting to regain control over time spent on technology — and companies are trying to help them. In August, Facebook FB, -0.33% announced new tools to help users monitor and reduce their usage of apps like Instagram and Facebook. The company said it worked with mental-health experts to create tools that will tell users how much time they spend on each app and allow them to self-impose limits that block them from using the app after a certain number of minutes or hours. Apple AAPL, +0.41% and Google GOOG, +0.97% have also unveiled similar tools to help consumers keep track of the hours they spend on iPhones and Android devices.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teenagers-may-actually-be-less-likely-to-text-and-drive-than-their-parents-2018-08-22,"Most teenagers don’t remember a world without smartphones. They’ve grown up with warnings about the dangers of smartphones and may have taken those lessons to heart.

Nearly 40% of teenage drivers age 14 years and older texted while driving at least once in the month prior, but that alarming figure is lower than several estimates for all adults, according to a new study led by the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. The study, conducted with researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The Ohio State University, crunched data from 35 states in the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey.

Texting while driving varied by state — from 26% in Maryland to 64% in South Dakota. “More teens texted while driving in states with a lower minimum learner’s permit age and in states where a larger percentage of students drove,” the study found. “White teens were more likely to text while driving than students of all other races/ethnicities. Texting while driving prevalence doubled between ages 15 and 16 years, and it continued to increase substantially for ages 17 years and up.”

However, the five states where more than 50% of teen drivers reported texting while driving had a learner’s permit age of 15 years or younger. “The increase in texting while driving at the age when teens can legally begin unsupervised driving was not surprising,” said Motao Zhu, the study’s lead author and principal investigator in the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “The earlier teens start driving, the earlier they start texting while driving.”

This tallies with a 2014 survey by AT&T, which found that 43% of teenagers said they texted and drove compared to 49% of all adults. As smartphones became ubiquitous, so too did distracted driving. And yet a 2013 study found that more teens are injured and killed every year due to distracted driving than drunk driving; the researchers said the reason was simple: they don’t drink seven days a week, but they carry their phones seven days a week.

Don’t miss: Tweeting and texting at work is catching flak

Cell phone use is estimated to be involved in 26% of all motor vehicle crashes, according to the National Safety Council. But it’s not texting that’s the biggest problem. Only 5% of cell phone-related crashes involve texting, while the other 21% involve drivers talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones. Apple AAPL, +0.41% is taking another approach. It wants to stop drivers from texting in the first place by hanging a “Do Not Disturb While Driving” sign on their iPhone’s iOS 11.

Federal law prohibits train engineers from using cell phones, but there’s no federal ban on car drivers. Some 16 states and the District of Columbia, however, do have bans on handheld cell phone use — including New York, New Jersey and California — and 47 states and D.C. explicitly ban texting (Washington was the first state to ban texting, in 2007). Another 38 states and D.C. ban all cell phone use by novice drivers.

Smartphones are as big a threat to driver safety as alcohol, safety experts say. They advocate a federal ban on all cell phone use while driving — including hands-free devices. Driving while using a cell phone reduces brain activity associated with driving — “spatial processing” that helps drivers remember and make sense of the objects on the street — by 37%, according to a 2008 research paper by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

And talking and texting on phones aren’t the only causes of distracted driving. “Discussions regarding distracted driving center around cell phone use and texting, but distracted driving also includes other activities such as eating, talking to other passengers, or adjusting the radio or climate controls,” according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This includes checking GPS navigation apps and in-vehicle entertainment systems.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-has-a-great-opportunity-in-india-says-suntrust-2018-08-24,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey upgraded Netflix shares on Friday to buy from hold, citing strong subscriber trends in the third quarter and promising opportunities in India.

The firm said its Google search trend analysis showed domestic subscriptions and international subscriptions tracking above consensus.

“Our Subscriber Tracker (through July) points to 3Q Domestic/Int’l subs tracking solidly in-line/ahead,” SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a note to investors Friday. “Note: Netflix hasn’t missed subs 2 quarters in a row since 2012,” he added.

At the same time, SunTrust lowered its price target for Netflix NFLX, -1.28% to $410 from $415, citing the company’s second-quarter subscriber miss. In its July 16 earnings announcement, the streaming giant said it had added 5.15 million streaming users, a substantial drop from the 6.2 million estimate it provided in April. Shares of the company have fallen 12.7% since then, though they have gained 82% in the year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% has gained 7.5% so far this year.

Thornton is mostly optimistic about Netflix and especially interested in its opportunities in India. “India is the key incremental market for Netflix in our view,” he wrote. The market is much larger than that in the U.S., he said, and he predicts the size gap will only widen over the next ten years.

Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said earlier this year that the company’s next 100 million subscribers would come from India, but the streaming giant faces significant challenges there. There are multiple local and global competitors, such as Indian video streaming firm Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video AMZN, +1.48% and pricing could be an issue. Netflix is currently available in India for a monthly subscription fee of $7 to $12 (500 to 800 rupees), significantly more expensive than the average pay-TV option. India also has far fewer broadband households than the U.S.

But Netflix has set up partnerships with local set-top box and mobile companies, such as Videocon, Bharti, Vodafone and Tata Sky, which Thornton thinks is a good move. He also expects the company to ramp up production of Indian originals, which have so far been warmly received by Indian audiences, based on SunTrust’s Google search trends analysis.

“Netflix appears to be gaining ground on an absolute and relative basis based on app store and search data,” Thornton wrote in his note. The company’s app is the most downloaded entertainment app in India’s Apple app store, according to SunTrust.

Netflix recently increased subscriber fees in Japan, and Thornton thinks that could be suggestive of strong subscriber trends. The streaming company also started testing a way for users to register and pay for the streaming service while bypassing Apple Inc.’s app store and hefty commission fees, another possible indication of strong subscriber trends, he wrote.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-you-missed-out-on-the-faangs-then-its-time-to-buy-the-baits-2018-08-24,"For anyone who went to business school, a conversation with money manager Albert Meyer is like a trip back in time — straight to accounting class, that is.

It’s never long before you get roped in to a discussion about the investing angles behind some nuanced accounting concept. But that’s not as grim or futile as it sounds.

No less an investing expert than Warren Buffett maintains that knowing your way around financials is the key to good investing. Buffett famously spends part of his weekends poring over balance sheets and income statements, and Meyer no doubt does the same.

Besides, accounting is sort of fun. It’s a combination of hard-nosed numbers crunching, strategic thinking and CSI. People who know their way around financials learn a lot about what companies are up to, where they are headed, and the tricks they use to cover up their mistakes.

This focus on accounting also boosts returns. Buffett is one of the best investors ever, but Meyer is no slouch. As of the end of July, investments at his Bastiat Capital were up 78.3% net of fees over the past five years, compared with 67% for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.08% He also outperforms over one and three years.

I’ve known Meyer and drawn on his ideas for investing columns on and off for over 15 years. It’s not really possible to sum up how he uses accounting analysis to make investment decisions in a brief column. People spend years learning about accounting, and Meyer has also spent years teaching it. But here are a few of his favorite concepts, which are fairly easy to understand and replicate in your own investment analysis.

Follow the money

Meyer spends a lot of time looking at compensation policies for executives, which you can find in the proxy statement.

“The compensation culture provides insight into the board and management philosophy toward shareholders,” he says. In short, compensation can tell you whether management really does put the interest of shareholders above theirs, as they are supposed to.

One of Meyers’ favorite tricks here is to look for an “options overhang” from excessive options grants. He shuns companies that have this for a simple reason. Sooner or later, assuming the stock does not tank, they will have to use precious cash flow to buy back stock to offset the dilution from all those options. This eats up cash flow that could go to shareholders, or get reinvested.

Back in 2006, Meyer was negative on Cisco CSCO, +0.45% in a column of mine for this reason. It would be nearly 10 years before the company’s stock would trade substantially above 2006 levels and hold the gains. It may not be a coincidence that by the time Cisco stock did this, the company had rolled back its extremely generous options grants.

Meyer prefers to see moderate pay and compensation in the form of cash. Or at least cash plus restricted stock units (stock grants with rules on how long managers must hold them) instead of options. There’s more room to fudge the accounting for options. When considering whether to own Mastercard MA, +0.80% or Visa V, +1.04% he opted for Mastercard because executive pay was more moderate and the options overhang was smaller. He likes Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.17% and Southern Copper SCCO, -0.07% in part, because they pay executives in cash.

Meyer thinks his approach on options helps keep him out of trouble. “I never bought Wells Fargo WFC, -0.16% even though Buffett liked it, because they were paying their CEO a lot and he was getting massive stock option grants. I wasn’t surprised when it blew up,” he says. Not every company that pays its CEO a lot is bad, but it’s a red flag at the very least.

Look for large insider ownership

The logic here isn’t hard to understand. If insiders have more money at stake, they’ll probably work harder for you as a shareholder. Meyer takes an interest when insider ownership is over 10%. You can find insider ownership levels in the proxy, too.

Companies he likes, in part, because they have high insider ownership include Sanofi SNY, -0.05% at 17%, IPG Photonics IPGP, +0.16% (34%), Checkpoint Software CHKP, +0.14% (25%), Amerco UHAL, -0.26% (46%) and Syntel SYNT, +0.02% (over 50%).

Inside net income

This is an old forensic accounting trick. The basic idea is that when net income is a lot larger than cash flow, companies may be using accounting gimmicks to prop up reported income. Meyer says the reasons they don’t match up can reveal a lot about a company and point to what you need to learn more about. A large amortization charge explaining the difference suggests a company made a lot of acquisitions. If so, Meyer compares a company’s profitability measures like return on assets to peers. If the company is less profitable, it suggests the company overpaid for the acquisitions.

After getting a feel for the financials, Meyer examines company presentations, 10K forms and conference calls to get a sense of the company’s strategy. He doesn’t use Wall Street sell-side research. Then he builds a five-year earnings model, and uses it as a score card to track quarterly earnings reports.

BAIT stocks

Meyer doesn’t own the FAANGs — Facebook FB, -0.31% Amazon.com AMZN, +1.46% Apple AAPL, +0.27% Netflix NFLX, -1.18% and Alphabet GOOG, +0.92% GOOGL, +1.04% Instead, he likes the Chinese equivalents, which he calls the BAIT stocks. This means Baidu BIDU, -0.13% Alibaba BABA, -0.43% IQIYI IQ, -1.11% and Tencent TCEHY, -1.46%

“They are FAANG copycats and they do it very well. They make a ton of money,” says Meyer.

Right now they are on sale because of worries about a U.S. trade war with China, yuan weakness, concerns about Google entering China, and a recent earnings miss at Tencent. It’s starting to look like a trade war will not play out. Meyer thinks Google isn’t really that big a threat to Baidu because it will take a while to become a big player in China. And he points out that Tencent earnings and sales are growing at more than 30%, which isn’t bad. If you missed out on the FAANGs, or you own them and you wonder how much higher they can go given their big gains, it may be time to buy the BAIT stocks.

Market outlook

For a conservative green-eye-shades guy, Meyer doesn’t hold back on his bullishness for the U.S. economy and stocks. Because of corporate tax cuts and accelerated depreciation on big-ticket purchases, companies are going to increase capital spending. And thanks to low unemployment, consumers are confident and opening up their wallets a lot more. Both of these trends mean continued economic growth ahead. Meyer thinks will it support another 40% move up in the S&P 500 to 4,000 — by 2020.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/timing-the-stock-market-is-tough-but-it-sure-doesnt-look-like-it-in-this-chart-2018-08-23,"“Buy here… sell here… it’s that simple.”

Those aren’t just famous last words, they are also what the Daily Reckoning blog’s Jody Chutley used to describe this chart:

The chart compares the valuation of the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% and it’s telling us that commodities have never been this inexpensive relative to the broader market.

“Historically, any time the ratio has gotten this low, the commodity index has bounced back very sharply,” he wrote, adding that where the ratio currently sits is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble... right before it burst.

So what’s the play if that ratio starts to climb, as Chudley expects? He said the answer lies in the composition of the GSCI, which is made up of a diversified basket of 24 different commodities, including energy products, industrial metals, agricultural products, livestock products and two precious metals. The weighting of each commodity shifts each year, and as it stands now, energy takes up almost 60%.

“While I have no doubt that almost all of these commodities are worthy of closer inspection, I can’t help but point out the fact that this screaming buy signal is more narrowly screaming, BUY ENERGY,” he wrote in his blog post.

Chudley says that a “significant risk” of a top in the market should have investors hesitant about buying into popular momentum stocks like Amazon AMZN, +1.48% , Apple AAPL, +0.41% , Microsoft MSFT, +0.84% and Netflix NFLX, -1.24% , and instead focus on where the next batch of gains is to be made.

“There are opportunities outside of these big expensive companies,” he said. “Energy and commodities in general definitely fit that bill.”

There are many ways to gain exposure to the group, including the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust GSG, +0.58% .But for a more focused play, Chudley suggests investors take a look at a“very much off-the-radar” oil CLV8, +0.80% producer from Canada, Cardinal Energy CRLFF, +0.09% .

“With a sensible balance sheet and juicy yield, Cardinal Energy would be a good start towards positioning your portfolio to take advantage of the current opportunity that the GSCI chart is screaming about,” he wrote.",2018-08-23,

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-15-us-companies-that-are-investing-the-most-in-tomorrows-big-ideas-2018-08-23,"Big U.S. technology and pharmaceutical companies have been pouring billions of dollars into research and development this year, driving up private-sector investments in intellectual property at the fastest pace in 12 years, according to government and corporate data.

These companies have led a surge in investments in R&D in the first half of the year.

The U.S. economy has been suffering from a lack of big ideas for years, so the surge in R&D spending this year is a welcome sign that corporations might finally be putting enough money into new ideas to move the dial on productivity growth, which has been lagging badly.

But we’ve seen similar R&D spikes before that quickly reverted to the mean.

Corporate data show that the 215 S&P 500 SPX, +0.09% companies that reported their R&D investments on a quarterly basis have increased them by more than $19 billion to $140 billion in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data from FactSet compiled by my colleague Philip van Doorn. That’s an annualized growth rate of about 33%.

Separate government data show that private-sector investments in intellectual property (a broader category than just R&D) have grown at an 11.1% annual rate so far this year to $893 billion, contributing about 0.5 percentage point to the 3.1% annualized economic growth rate, their biggest contribution since 1999, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Private investments in intellectual property have been quite volatile over the past 20 years.

That’s a larger contribution to first-half growth than was made by investments either in equipment or in structures.

Of course, a two-quarter trend is hardly a definitive sign that businesses have permanently ramped up their investments in intellectual property such as R&D, software and artistic originals. Still, it’s probably the least-known piece of good news on the economy.

Could the recent corporate tax cuts have something to do with the spike in R&D? Sure, it’s possible; we’ll have to wait to see if the increase continues in coming years, or whether the spike fades away as it has always done over the past 20 years.

Most of these companies have plenty of cash on hand, so availability of capital hasn’t been what’s holding them back. Reacting to market opportunities is the biggest reason companies invest in R&D, not the cost of capital. But the tax cut might also be accelerating some R&D, because the law will require amortization of R&D beginning in 2022.

Information technology, pharmaceuticals

It won’t surprise anyone that information technology and pharmaceuticals dominate the industries plowing the most back into R&D.

Of the S&P 500 companies reporting R&D quarterly, here are the top spenders over their last two quarters: Amazon AMZN, +1.33% Alphabet GOOG, +0.95% Microsoft MSFT, +0.65% Apple AAPL, +0.34% Intel INTC, -0.23% , Merck MRK, -0.39% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.08% Facebook FB, -0.20% Bristol-Myers-Squibb BMY, +0.22% Pfizer PFE, -0.49% Celgene CELG, -0.01% Cisco Systems CSCO, +0.45% Oracle ORCL, +0.31% Qualcomm QCOM, -0.24% and IBM IBM, +0.25% .

Each of these companies has invested more than $2.5 billion in the previous two quarters. In large part, they are trying to maximize their market share for fast-growing technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and new drugs.

Note that Amazon doesn’t report “research and development” but a somewhat broader category: “technology and content,” which includes some spending on equipment, property, software and artistic content.

What’s missing from this list? Investments by auto makers, aerospace, other industrial companies, energy, materials and chemicals. A lot of the investments that are expected to transform our economy and our world in the next few decades — self-driving vehicles, robotics, renewable energy, nanotechnology — aren’t being made primarily by the companies that report quarterly numbers.

Fortunately, some companies with very large R&D budgets — including Ford F, -0.45% General Motors GM, -0.67% General Electric GE, -0.18% DowDuPont DWDP, -0.24% Procter & Gamble PG, +0.12% AT&T T, -0.39% Honeywell HON, +0.36% Lockheed Martin LMT, -0.06% and Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.09% — are investing in these areas. We just won’t know how much they’ve invested until they file their annual reports.

Why R&D matters

Why does R&D matter? Because the research we do today provides the breakthroughs that will lead to the amazing goods and services of tomorrow. High levels of R&D are associated with higher productivity growth, which is the missing ingredient that has limited U.S. potential economic growth to the 2% range, rather than being able to grow at 3% or more.

Globally, the United States invests more in R&D than any other country, more than $550 billion a year, about 25% of the global total. But China and other Asian economies are catching up quickly, with growth rates about twice as high. R&D Magazine predicted in March that global R&D would rise 4.1% in 2018. U.S. investments so far this year seem to be exceeding its forecast.

Unfortunately, R&D dollars don’t go nearly as far as they used to; we’re getting less bang for every buck. It takes more hours of research to produce a patent, for instance. There’s a kind of reverse Moore’s Law in place. Indeed, one study found that it takes 18 times as many research hours today to double the density of computer chips than it took in the early 1970s.

Some have theorized that good ideas are harder to find. We’ve been dipping into the same “pool of ideas” since the 1980s. Most of the good ideas have been commercialized.

As a society, ideally we’d be investing two to four times as much as we do in R&D in order to maximize society-wide welfare, according to economists at Stanford University and MIT.

But the private-sector under-invests in R&D, because companies cannot capture the full social benefits of new ideas and technologies they develop. Some of the knowledge “spills” over and benefits competitors and the general public. That’s why R&D is considered, in part, a “public good.”

Government puts a lot of money into basic research, whereas businesses tend to fund late-stage development that can be quickly commercialized. However, federal funding for research hasn’t kept pace with the growth in the economy; in the past 10 years, federal R&D investments have risen just 0.3% per year after adjusting for inflation.

The spike in private R&D spending so far this year is a piece of welcome news, but it’s not enough.

To boost standards of living and labor productivity, we need a lot more than research into cloud computing and the development of expensive new drugs that will help a relatively small number of patients. Above all, we need to ensure the transformative products and services of the future will benefit the economy broadly — and don’t just contribute further to the concentration of industry and inequality of income and wealth.",2018-08-23,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fund-managers-cut-fang-exposure-biggest-move-is-away-from-amazon-2018-08-23,"Stock pickers, broadly speaking, don’t have dazzling track records when it comes to how their choices compare to the overall U.S. stock market. In 2018, however, they’ve been avoiding some of the most high-profile — and most high-flying — names out there, a seemingly contrary bet that has protected them from recent weakness.

According to data from Goldman Sachs, mutual funds have been reducing their exposure to the so-called FANG group of stocks, a quartet of technology and internet names where the acronym refers to Facebook FB, -0.33% Amazon AMZN, +1.48% Netflix NFLX, -1.24% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, +0.96% GOOGL, +1.02% (Some analysts also include Apple AAPL, +0.41% in the unofficial group.)

These stocks have led the market higher for years, including throughout much of 2018, but the trade recently hit a rough patch, with Facebook and Netflix in particular suffering steep losses in the wake of their most recent quarterly results. Netflix is down nearly 19% from an all-time high hit earlier this year, while Facebook has slumped more than 20%.

“The collapse in FB’s stock price in July would have boosted mutual fund performance given their underweight exposure to the stock,” Goldman wrote in a note to clients.

On average, funds focused on large-capitalization U.S. stocks were underweight on Facebook by 20 basis points relative to its weighting in the S&P 500 at the start of the third quarter, per Goldman’s data. They are underweight Netflix by the same amount, which represents a slight increase in how underweight they are; at the start of the second quarter, they were underweight by 17 basis points.

Overall, funds are underweight the FANG group by 75 basis points; at the start of the second quarter, they were underweight by 56 basis points.

Much of that increase reflects a move away from Amazon. Fund managers are, on average, underweight the e-commerce giant by 47 basis points, compared with 38 basis points at the start of the second quarter. Separately, while managers are more overweight on Alphabet, the degree to which they are lessened over the quarter. Currently, they’re overweight Google’s parent by 11 basis points, compared with 19 at the start of the second quarter.

The retreat from FANG stocks has been a trend for months. Large-cap funds have been underweight the group since mid-2017, and in the year prior to that, they had been trimming how overweight they were on the stocks.

Courtesy Goldman Sachs

Given the size of the FANG stocks, and given how big their share-price moves have been, FANG exposure has been correlated with how well these fund managers perform. But whereas being underweight them over the past year has limited their gains, it has recently insulated them from some of the market’s most precipitous drops. Per Goldman, the number of funds outperformaning their benchmark is above the 10-year average thus far this year, though the ratio has come down a bit from earlier in 2018.

Since 2014, Goldman wrote, “large-cap core mutual funds have usually outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% on a day when one or more FANG stocks have declined by 5%+.”

This trend stands in stark contrast with hedge funds, where Facebook is a top holding by a large number of firms, something that has contributed to hedge-fund underperformance this year.

Not all FANG stocks have struggled this year. Amazon is within 2% of records, singlehandedly providing a sizable lift to the overall market. Apple, a stock Goldman didn’t include in its analysis, is also up on the year, a rally that helped it crest $1 trillion in market capitalization. Alphabet is less than 6% below its own record.

Overall, mutual funds trimmed how overweight they are on the technology sector by 11 basis points over the second quarter, the second-largest negative change in sector allocation. For consumer-discretionary stocks, a sector that includes Amazon and Netflix, the overweight allocation dropped by 6 basis points.

Financial stocks saw a much larger drop in allocation. On average, per Goldman’s data, funds cut their overweight exposure on the sector by 107 basis points.

On the other end of the spectrum, funds turned overweight on health-care stocks, and now have an allocation to the group that 15 basis points larger than the market. That’s up 44 basis points from the start of the second quarter.",2018-08-23,Goldman Sachs

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-dangerous-trade-is-making-a-comeback-and-that-is-a-worry-for-stocks-saxo-bank-2018-08-23,"As we near the finish line of a long week in politics, the Fed is swinging back on the radar for investors.

Minutes published by the central bank on Wednesday, which showed a September rate increase is firmly on the cards, have helped distract from some legal heat circling former Trump advisers. Jackson Hole here we come.

Those Fed musings also took a bit of steam out of the S&P 500, something that could continue this morning as the buck stomps ahead. And it could muddy the waters for those wondering whether to dive into the longest bull market on record.

Our call of the day, from Saxo Bank's Peter Garnry, advises opting for the latter strategy as he warns of a “dangerous trade” that’s been making a comeback, and which he says could blindside the market.

He says investors have been buying stocks and pushing the S&P 500 to new highs while paying “record premium” for hedging against downside risk in the index via the Cboe SKEW Index SKEW, -2.74% That’s shown in the following chart:

Saxo Group

“The most popular ETN engaging in shorting short-term VIX futures is up 25% from its April lows,” said Garnry, in a follow-up email to a recent webinar where he laid out those concerns.

He says this structure was in place during all of 2017—notable moments are here and here—and then earlier this year. “It is a big worry for me that we are back to this market structure again…with the U.S. equity market having outperformed massively all other markets on top of compressed implied volatility,” says Garnry.

He says it “sets the stage for a violent drop in U.S. equities should we get some exogenous shock to the system.”

One alternative? Emerging markets.

Garnry acknowledges that emerging markets have lots of structural issues, but maintains they can still yield attractive returns. To be sure, there are plenty of emerging-markets haters out there, which some could be a reason to dive in. Don’t count Deutsche Bank in that camp. They’ve got a laundry list of reasons why it is too soon to seek out those far-flung stocks.

The chart

Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street has hawks on his mind as he takes a deep dive into the Fed minutes. He discovered the central bank used the word “strong” 32 times at its most recent meeting, a 150% increase on a year earlier and maybe the most ever for a set of minutes.

“Even in 2005, during the first half of the rate-hike cycle at the time, when the Fed was gung-ho about the economy, the word “strong” appeared between 3 times and 9 times in the minutes,” says Richter.

So he stacked that up against some history, and, voilà, the following chart, which he advises to take with several grains of salt, explained fully in his blog.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-to-yank-onavo-data-security-app-from-apple-store-2018-08-22,"Facebook Inc. plans to pull its data-security app from Apple Inc.’s app store after the iPhone maker ruled that the service violated its data-collection policies, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Apple’s AAPL, +0.41% decision widens the schism between the two tech giants over privacy and is a blow to Facebook FB, -0.33% , which has used data gathered through the app to track rivals and scope out new product categories. The app, called Onavo Protect, has been available free download through Apple’s app store for years, with updates regularly approved by Apple’s app-review board.

Onavo allows users to create a virtual private network that redirects internet traffic to a private server managed by Facebook. The app, which bills itself as a way to “keep you and your data safe,” also alerts users when they visit potentially malicious sites. Facebook is able to collect and analyze Onavo users’ activity to get a picture of how people use their phones beyond Facebook’s apps.

Earlier this month, Apple officials informed Facebook that the app violated new rules outlined in June designed to limit data collection by app developers, the person familiar with the situation said. Apple informed Facebook that Onavo also violated a part of its developer agreement that prevents apps from using data in ways that go beyond what is directly relevant to the app or to provide advertising, the person added.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-analyst-is-now-a-lot-more-bullish-on-amazon-alphabet-and-spotify-2018-08-22,"Rob Sanderson at MKM Partners raised his stock-price target on Amazon.com Inc. by 20% on Wednesday, joining a host of other Wall Street analysts that expect a further rise above $2,000, and he also became a lot more bullish on Spotify Technology S.A. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Sanderson nudged up his price target on Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.24% by a mere 1.3% but said he was “enthusiastic” about the stock at current levels.

He lifted his Amazon AMZN, +1.48% stock-price target to $2,215 from $1,840, leaving just three of the 47 analysts surveyed by FactSet with targets below the $2,000 mark. The e-commerce behemoth’s stock was up 0.8% in afternoon trades, sitting 1.1% below its Aug. 14 record close of $1,919.65.

“We think the margin story at [Amazon] is set up very well for the next several quarters,” Sanderson wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his buy rating, saying he believes Amazon’s cloud business, Amazon Web Services (or AWS), is in a “sweet spot” for margin expansion, as the period of aggressive buildout investments that had weighed on margins has now been “lapped.”

Based on 487.74 million shares outstanding as of July 18, the new price target, which is 17% above current levels, would imply a market capitalization of about $1.08 trillion.

He said the next big outlay for Amazon is likely to be in grocery delivery, which could end up as the company’s largest category expansion ever, but spending appears to be ramping up at a measured pace, suggesting the impact on margins may be more gradual.

“We still think that [Amazon] is the best long-term-growth investment available to investors today,” Sanderson said.

The stock has soared 62% in 2018, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% has rallied 14% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% has gained 7.1%.

For Spotify SPOT, -0.45% , Sanderson boosted his target by 23% to $245, which is about 28% above current levels. That would SPOT, -0.45% tie him with an undisclosed analyst for the highest share-price target among the 29 analysts surveyed by FactSet.

He reiterated his buy rating, saying the company has “great monetization potential” in areas outside of music streaming, which it is likely to dominate. The shares was up 0.6% in afternoon trade Wednesday, reversing earlier losses of as much as 1.1%. They have climbed 29% since closing at $149.01 on the stock’s first day of trading, April 3.

“We believe [Spotify] is becoming the primary platform to connect music fans and artists,” Sanderson wrote. “We think this opens several incremental monetization opportunities in data, analytical tools, tour marketing and support, ticketing, merchandise sales, etc.”

Sanderson gave Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +1.02% stock-price target an 8.1% boost to $1,465, from $1,355, which would put it 20% above current levels. With about 695.7 million total shares outstanding, according to FactSet, the new target implies a market cap of about $1.02 trillion, allowing the Google parent to join Apple, and Amazon were it to beat Alphabet to the punch, atop the $1 trillion market-cap level.

While increasing traffic-acquisition costs, or TAC, have weighed on operating margins for the past three years, Sanderson said the TAC headwinds finally appear to be easing, which will allow Alphabet to “reflate” margins in the second half of the year. Read more about Alphabet’s latest earnings report.

The stock gained 0.3% Wednesday and has advanced 16% so far this year.

“We think the margin outlook could improve” as websites TAC escalation slows after having served as a drag on results for three years, Sanderson wrote. “We think the stock represents very good growth at reasonable price” and is a better investment from a risk-vs-reward standpoint than almost any other blue-chip component of a large-cap market index.

For Netflix’s stock, Sanderson lifted his price target to $395, which is 15% above current levels, from $390, saying his previous caution has now been reversed following a recent pullback. The stock had surged 2% by afternoon and has run up 8.9% over the past three sessions, yet was still 18% below the July 9 record close of $418.97.

Sanderson believes Netflix will grow U.S. subscribership to 90 million and international subscriber rolls to 300 million by 2025, he said. Content spending, according to Sanderson, could triple by 2025 and “deeply penetrate the mass consumer market” on a global basis by then.

The S&P 500 set a new record Tuesday and the bull market is about to claim the crown as the longest in history Wednesday. But things could get even more awesome for the market as it heads into what may be shaping up to be a very bullish season.

Over the past decade, the one-month period from Tuesday’s close has been among the strongest for equities, according to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.

“We’re entering a period of the calendar year that has been exceptionally bullish for the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. Over the next month, the S&P 500 has posted a median gain of 3.31%, which gets a ‘perfect’ rating when looking at all one-month periods of the year,” said Justin Walters, co-founder of Bespoke, in a report.

Bespoke Investment Group

The S&P 500’s SPX, +0.14% performance over the next three months is even more impressive, with the large-cap index posting a median gain of 5.9% over the past 10 years. And during this three-month period, all S&P 500 sectors have risen, led by technology stocks at 8.7% and energy at 7.46%.

In the past 10 years, the best-performing stocks from Aug. 21 to Nov. 19 were Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. GELYF, -0.68% , which posted a median gain of 36%, and Seagate Technology PLC STX, -0.16% , which jumped a median of 21%. Somewhat surprisingly, the so-called FAANG stocks — an acronym for the immensely popular Facebook Inc. FB, -0.33% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.41% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.48% , Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.24% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.02% GOOG, +0.96% — do not figure prominently in this list, with Netflix showing up at eighth-best with a median 18% increase.

However, some of that seasonal magic may be offset by political uncertainty.

Data from MKM Partners show that stocks underperform in the second half of midterm election years, with the market witnessing a pullback of 11% on average.

Still, on the whole, the backdrop for stocks is mostly bullish and the market is well-positioned to extend gains into the end of the year, according to analysts.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-stock-market-can-ignore-those-trump-headlines-unless-this-happens-2018-08-22,"Welcome to the longest bull market in history, though it may not look like much of a party this morning.

Wall Street is sagging a bit at the start after two of Trump’s top one-time aides were rung up on charges late Tuesday and one pointed the finger at his former boss. The headlines are likely to be a distraction for investors today.

The “story has legs and we don’t’ know where it will go,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, told clients, though he says “a big market shock doesn’t’ appear to be on the cards.

In any case, investors can’t be blamed for once again asking whether their long run of good fortune will finally be derailed by Washington politics. That leads us to our call of the day, from Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth, who has an idea of just when investors watch out.

“U.S. President Trump faces either double trouble or a witch hunt, depending on which interpretation of events one wishes to use,” he says in an audio commentary for clients. “Directly, this matters if politics impacts either U.S. policy or the markets view of the risks around U.S. policy.”

When to worry? If economy policy is used as a distraction from the headlines, he says.

“This is where trade risks come in,” he says. “The U.S. president has very considerable power over trade policy, and taxing U.S. consumers via trade taxes can be made to serve the ‘Make America Great Again,’ slogan. To that extent, the U.S. administration may feel that increased trade tensions are a way of hiding domestic political troubles.”

And trade has been a recurring headache for investors, although it, too, hasn’t been able to pull this bull market off track. As Joshua Mahoney, market analyst at IG, notes, markets recognize Trump is divisive, but they also like his economic expansionary policies. “Any threat to a second term will rattle markets.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/8-signs-your-partner-is-cheating-on-you-financially-2018-08-22,"Of course, if your partner pulls a Kristen Stewart or a Tiger Woods, it’s a clear breach of trust. But there’s another kind of cheating that can be just as devastating to a relationship.

A 2018 CreditCards.com survey explored financial infidelity, which unearthed surprising revelations: 15 million people with live-in partners admit to being financially unfaithful, with an additional nine million saying they had been in the past. The consequences can be disastrous. Thirty-one percent said they felt hiding a credit card or bank account from a significant other is worse than physical cheating.

Since the signs of financial infidelity aren’t always obvious, we talked to experts about the top red flags to look out for.

1. They sidestep money conversations.

Let’s say you notice your honey sprung for a new speaker system or bought an over-the-top wedding present—but when you ask what it cost, he (or she) blows you off, gives a vague answer or segues into a debrief of the Eagles’ big win.

“This behavior usually reflects a desire to avoid conflict,” explains Certified Financial Planner Brad Klontz, PsyD, founder of the Financial Psychology Institute. “They might be hiding a money disorder like chronic overspending or giving too much to others.”

2. They’re anxious or temperamental.

Whether someone’s lying about the last time they texted their ex or how much they’re spending, moods can be indicators that something’s off. If your partner shows signs of stress—particularly, but not necessarily exclusively, when you talk dollars and cents—and you can’t pinpoint what’s wrong, that’s a clue, Klontz says.

3. They’re in charge of your joint finances…

And they’re resistant to your participation. Or they want to assume more control over money matters than usual. According to Klontz, any effort to cut you out of financial issues begs further investigation.

4. You haven’t set a budget.

Financial infidelity isn’t always intentional. “If couples don’t have an explicit agreement around how much is OK to spend, one person can feel betrayed when the other spends a lot—even though it wasn’t purposeful deception,” Klontz says. To avoid miscommunication, consult one another before making any purchase over an agreed-upon amount.

5. Unfamiliar tax forms arrive in the mail.

When someone has a secret bank account or investments, chances are they’ll set up everything online, rather than having paper statements mailed, according to Certified Public Accountant Robert Nemeth of Apple Growth Partners in Ohio. But many tax documents are still delivered old school. Now is the time to keep your eyes peeled for 1099 forms from banks you weren’t aware your partner was affiliated with.

6. There’s an increase in ATM withdrawals.

It might seem obvious, but Nemeth says this is the most common financial infidelity giveaway: “Taking out an extra $200 a week, for instance, is an easy way to shore up cash without the other person noticing,” he says. “It slips through the cracks, but quickly adds up.”

An uptick in credit card activity (or cash advances on a credit card) is another seeming no-brainer that happens all the time, especially if your partner pays the bills. “The data is typically there as plain as day; people just don’t look,” Nemeth says.

7. Promotional material from a new bank arrives.

After someone opens an online bank or investment account, the institution typically begins sending an influx of credit card applications and other offers. “An increase in activity from one particular bank could indicate deception,” Nemeth says.

8. Banks or income you don’t recognize are listed on your tax returns.

If you’re not the one preparing your tax return, review it carefully to see if there’s money coming in from a source you don’t know about.

Pay particular attention here: “Schedule B lists all the interest and dividend income, as well as the name of the institution paying it,” Nemeth says. “Schedule D indicates any sales of investments.” For example, if you see that stocks were liquidated for $5,000, but don’t recall discussing it, it could be a sign of behind-the-scenes sketchiness.

Aside from not signing the tax return until you’re on the same page, this is your chance to have a frank conversation about what’s been going on—and how you can be on the same page moving forward.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dear-elon-ask-apple-or-google-to-acquire-tesla-2018-08-21,"Steve Jobs wanted to build an electric car as far back as 2008.

In 2014, current Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly funded the project. To date, though, Apple AAPL, +0.42% has had little to show for it, and the rumors are that its electric vehicle will launch as late as 2025 — long after such things become common commodities. Alphabet’s Google GOOG, +0.96% GOOGL, +1.02% has had self-driving electric cars on the road for about four years, though it has decided to focus primarily on the software.

A decade after Tesla TSLA, -0.67% announced the Model S, and six years after its delivery, no other company has been able to produce anything comparable. The big automotive manufacturers are claiming that they will soon eat Tesla’s lunch, but even the strongest offerings — those of BMW and Mercedes — are merely souped-up cassette players trying to compete with an iPod.

Read: Nio IPO: 5 things to know about the ‘Chinese Tesla’

Tesla learned the hard way the intricacies of combining legacy automotive technologies with modern software — through trial and error and constant delay. It also struggled to automate production. Using advanced robots, however, it has finally figured out how to build an astonishing 6,000 cars per week, some in a tent.

At a crossroads

Now, as Tesla struggles with its cash balances, extremely negative press, and CEO Elon Musk’s erratic tweets, it is at another crossroads and, in order to reach its potential, needs a strategic partner. It may not make sense for it to continue as a public company.

The best acquirer would not be Saudi Arabia, whose interest Musk tweeted about, because that nation’s interests inherently conflict with Tesla’s. Electric vehicles and solar technologies will cause the price of oil to plummet and decimate the value of Saudi oil reserves, so it would lose heavily if its investment in Tesla paid off. Technology companies, however, share Musk’s goals and ambitions, particularly Apple and Google. They have the money, technology, and marketing strengths to greatly enhance Tesla’s offerings. Apple also has great manufacturing prowess and distribution channels.

Tesla would provide Apple with an entirely new set of technology platforms on which it could build a new line of products. Apple desperately needs these in order to sustain its trillion-dollar market capitalization; after the release of the iPhone, in 2007, it has had virtually no world-changing products. It needs to enter new markets, and, with its automotive, energy storage and solar technologies, Tesla would provide them.

Apple’s existing products would also benefit from the advanced technologies that electric cars have incorporated, such a batteries and in-car electronics. And Apple would gain the second-best self-driving software in the industry.

The iCar

Tesla could, in turn, integrate the iPad, Apple TV, iTunes, and App Store into its automotives, literally turning its vehicles into iCars. And it could replace its clunky operating system with macOS. I am sure that all Tesla owners — such as me — would love to be able to download apps and music onto a console that’s more user friendly than the Tesla’s present one.

Apple would bring its world-class manufacturing and inventory-management process to Tesla and create new types of automobiles, in different sizes and shapes — and at lower prices. This would give it a second chance to wow markets it has largely lost; specifically India and China.

A match for Waymo

Google’s interests also coincide with Tesla’s. Google doesn’t have Apple’s manufacturing capability, but its maps and self-driving software are one or two notches above any other. Tesla’s mapping software is substandard, and its self-driving software could use a major upgrade. Google’s self-driving-car spinoff, Waymo, could focus on the software and let Google’s Tesla arm deal with the hardware.

Given that Morgan Stanley has just valued Waymo at $175 billion, Tesla’s $70 billion price would be a no-brainer, and the combination would be formidable.

Getting Musk to the table

Would Musk even entertain such an offer? Given that he reportedly turned down an offer from Google in 2013 and laughed off the idea of Apple buying Tesla in emails I exchanged with him in April 2014, and in an investor call last year, it would seem very unlikely. Yet, having reached his personal limits and being close to burnout, as Musk has admitted; after seeing the disastrous impact of his tweet about having secured funding; and with Saudi Arabia offering investment in a competing startup, things may have changed.

I’ll bet that Musk would take an offer that solved his financial problems and gave him autonomy. With the headaches of funding and quarterly stock pressure taken away, the world’s greatest innovator would be free to develop world-changing ideas that transform entire industries, including automotive, energy and space. That would be a win-win for Tesla — and for humanity.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/small--and-micro-cap-stocks-get-another-look-as-the-sp-500-index-stalls-2018-08-17,"As large-cap U.S. stocks, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, have stalled this summer, some investors have rushed into smaller companies, which are benefitting from a tax cut and a strong domestic economy.

That has helped shine a light on little-known companies and the funds that own them.

The AMG Managers Cadence Emerging Companies Fund is one of those. Mike Skillman and Bob Fitzpatrick of Cadence Capital Management run the fund, which is rated five stars by Morningstar, the research firm’s highest rating. The AMG Managers Cadence Emerging Companies Fund MECAX, -0.48% is a domestically focused portfolio of small-cap and micro-cap stocks.

Skillman is the CEO of Cadence Capital Management, which has $4.5 billion in assets under management and is headquartered in Boston. He joined Cadence in 1994 and has been co-managing the fund since 2006. Fitzpatrick joined Cadence in 1999 and has co-managed the fund since 2004. The AMG Managers Cadence Emerging Companies Fund has $170 million in assets, and the firm manages a total of $230 million using the same strategy.

In an interview on Aug. 15, Skillman and Fitzpatrick explained that they aim to hold shares of 90 to 100 companies in the fund. These are drawn from “the bottom half of the Russell 2000 Index RUT, -0.14% ” with market capitalizations ranging from about $50 million to $1.5 billion with an emphasis on companies valued between $500 million and $700 million.

This approach provides diversification from the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.14% which is heavily weighted toward the FAANG stocks, which include Facebook FB, -0.32% Amazon.com AMZN, +1.48% Apple AAPL, +0.42% Netflix NFLX, -1.29% and Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, +0.96% GOOGL, +1.02% (Another highly rated fund we covered recently that provides international diversification away from the large-cap U.S. benchmark is the Evermore Global Value Fund.)

The AMG Managers Cadence Emerging Companies Fund limits its exposure to 2% of assets for any stock, generally starting a position at 1% and then cutting them back when they hit 2%.

A winning strategy

Fitzpatrick said that over the very long term, small-cap and micro-cap U.S. stocks have significantly outperformed shares of larger companies. This chart uses data going back to 1927 to compare the total and average returns of various market-cap ranges:

Cadence Capital Management This chart incorporates data from the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices and the FAMA/French data library.

More recently, the S&P 500‘s average return over the past 10 years has been 10.4%, compared to 9.5% for the Russell Microcap Index RUMIC, -0.02%

Fitzpatrick said Wall Street analysts tend to overlook small-cap and micro-cap stocks (many of which are too small even to be included in the Russell Microcap Index) because “the profitability of the sell-side firms is driven by covering the bigger companies.”

He said the firm’s name, Cadence, “came from the rhythmic, repeatable process,” which is designed to lead to “rhythmic, repeatable good results.”

Picking stocks

Skillman described a “growth at a reasonable price” strategy following a “disciplined and rigorous process.” He said that increases in earnings are what ultimately drive stock prices higher, but also emphasized the importance of identifying companies whose valuations to earnings are attractive.

“Investors may be skeptical of a company because of past difficulties, there can be industry effects that would cause investors to be wary of a particular sector and more broadly, cyclical companies are sometimes viewed skeptically by growth investors,” he said.

So there can be overlooked value opportunities among companies that he and Fitzpatrick determine have “improving earnings profiles,” he said.

Fitzpatrick said that after screening stocks for “a manageable list that looks good by the numbers,” he and Skillman then identify the drivers for sales and earnings growth, along with risks that may not be reflected in the numbers, including problems with management, litigation or “binary events” for biotech companies holding drug trials or waiting for FDA decisions.

Three examples

Fitzpatrick named three companies held by the fund as examples of companies on upward earnings trajectories with strong balance sheets that may be underappreciated by the market:

TransAct Technologies

TransAct Technologies TACT, +1.02% of Hamden, Conn., provides printing equipment that can be embedded in other systems. Nearly half the company’s revenue comes from manufacturers of gaming equipment, including slot machines that provide winners with tickets they can cash in, rather than spewing buckets of coins. The company also provides printing equipment used in point-of-sale transaction processing, banking, lotteries, restaurants and other industries.

In its second-quarter 10-Q filing, the company said its 9% increase in quarterly sales from a year earlier was driven in part by a “21% increase in sales of our Ithaca 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s MCD, +0.58% have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.” That increase was partially offset by a 71% decline in sales for legacy banking and point-of-sale products, but the company expects the McDonald’s revenue to remain at the same level during the third quarter.

Earnings for the second quarter were up 33%.

The decline in sales of older banking and point-of-sale products is a long-term trend for the company as it focuses on its restaurant and gaming products. Fitzpatrick said the company has opportunities with restaurant chains, which include labeling systems to make “the back office [kitchens] more efficient,” while also addressing food safety efforts and a limited labor supply.

TransAct Technologies has no debt and what Fitzpatrick called a “reasonable valuation” at 17 times his estimate of earnings over the next 12 months.

Kingstone Cos.

Kingstone Cos. KINS, +0.52% is a property and casualty insurer that is based in Kingston, New York. The company has branched out beyond its home state into New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Fitzpatrick expects it to expand into Connecticut and New Hampshire in 2019.

A.M. Best upgraded its financial strength rating for Kingstone to an A-minus (excellent) from B++ (good) in April 2017, and Fitzpatrick said the upgrade had played a significant role in helping the company “win good business.” Kingstone said its direct premiums written during the second quarter were up 21% from a year earlier, while earnings rose 10%.

“The stock trades for about two times book value and 13 times [his estimate of forward] earnings,” Fitzpatrick said. He said that valuation was a bit high for an insurance company but that it was appropriate “because of the growth.”

PRGX Global

PRGX Global PRGX, +1.59% is in a fascinating business: audit recovery. The company helps customers recover money from suppliers. For example, a retailer may have complicated arrangements through which suppliers provide rebates. “There are a lot of details in the contract terms, so it is sometimes difficult to manage properly,” Fitzpatrick said.

PRGX uses a customer’s data to prove to suppliers how much is owed to its customers.

Skillman said the standard term for the money that needs to be recovered is “leakage in the supply chain.” This is especially important in mature industries, including retail, because of pressure on profit margins, he said..

Fitzpatrick said the company is “well-positioned in terms of investments in its technology platform. It is gaining share, modestly. There are potential applications in oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and other areas.”

Fitzpatrick is a believer in the company’s targets for “high single digits” sales growth this year, along with an increase in EBITDA of about 20%. The shares trade for about eight times his estimate for EBITDA — a level he believes is attractive.

More stocks held by the fund

Skillman and Fitzpatrick stressed that their aim is to balance the fund’s holdings among a group of 90 to 100 stocks. Morningstar has a list of the fund’s largest 10 holdings as of July 31. However, the fact that these weights are on the high side for the fund probably reflects how well the stocks have performed. This is in no way a a list of the fund managers’ “favorites.”

That being said, here are the largest 10 holdings of the AMG Managers Cadence Emerging Companies Fund as of July 31:

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/charting-an-august-breakout-attempt-sp-500-approaches-record-territory-2018-08-21-121033110,"Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have weathered a respectable mid-August whipsaw, rising from successful tests of well-defined support.

In the process, the S&P 500’s record high (2,872) is firmly within striking distance, while the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have already edged to uncharted territory.

Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, +0.14% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.

As illustrated, the S&P has extended its rally from major support (2,802).

Additional resistance matches the August peak (2,863) and is closely followed by the S&P’s absolute record peak (2,872.67), established Jan. 26.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied more aggressively from support.

To reiterate, the range bottom closely matches key trendline support, illustrated on the daily chart — the 25,150 area. The steep rally from support places the Dow at five-month highs.

Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite’s COMP, +0.34% rally attempt registers as comparably lukewarm.

Still, the index has rallied from major support matching the 50-day moving average — also illustrated below — rising atop near-term trendline resistance.

Widening the view to six months adds perspective.

On this wider view, the Nasdaq twice maintained trendline support last week, and subsequently rallied slightly atop the former breakdown point (7,806).

The trendline closely tracks the 50-day moving average, currently 7,750, and the Nasdaq’s intermediate-term bias remains bullish barring a violation.

Looking elsewhere, the Dow industrials’ backdrop continues to strengthen.

In its case, the index nailed trendline support last week, also briefly tagging the 50-day moving average.

The subsequent steep rally from support places the Dow in less-charted territory at five-month highs. Modest overhead matches the late-February peak (25,800) and is currently under siege.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 nailed major support last week, bottoming at 2,802.5.

The sharp reversal punctuates a successful retest, placing the August peak (2,863) under siege, and the S&P’s record high (2,872.67) within view.

The bigger picture

As detailed above, the U.S. benchmarks have weathered a respectable mid-August downdraft fueled by possibly overblown concerns regarding Turkey’s currency crisis.

On a headline basis:

The Nasdaq Composite has maintained trendline support, a level closely tracking the 50-day moving average.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also rallied from trendline support and the 50-day moving average.

The S&P 500 has reversed sharply from the 2,802 breakout point.

The successful retests of well-defined support are technically constructive.

Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -0.27% may be poised to take flight.

Recall that its record close (169.97) is closely followed by the absolute record peak (170.20).

The small-cap benchmark has cleared both levels early Tuesday — reaching uncharted territory — opening the path to potentially material follow-through.

Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has already broken out, though narrowly, notching an all-time closing high.

The breakout resolves a bullish ascending triangle, and punctuates a successful test of trendline support.

Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.10% has rallied from its breakout point.

The SPY’s August peak (286.01) defines a six-month high and is currently under siege.

Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, its mid-year price action remains technical, even amid volatile patches, like the recent Turkey-fueled market whipsaw.

As detailed repeatedly, major support matches the breakout point, an area broadly spanning from 2,787 to 2,802. The 50-day moving average, currently 2,796, effectively bisects this band.

The S&P bottomed last week at 2,802.5 — matching support — and the subsequent sharp rally preserves a bullish intermediate-term bias.

Beyond specific levels, the August market whipsaw has been punctuated by healthy sector rotation, including a transports’ resurgence, detailed in the next section. (Also see Monday’s review, detailing the sub-sector backdrop.)

Separately, the Dow industrials and Nasdaq Composite have maintained trendline support, also strengthening the bull case.

Tuesday’s Watch List

The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.

Drilling down further, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -0.02% has reached a key technical test, rising amid guarded optimism that U.S.-China trade policy progress may be pending.

Specifically, the shares have rallied from 13-month lows, rising to challenge the August breakdown point (41.60). A return to the former range would mark a step toward stabilization.

On further strength, the 50-day moving average (43.10) is closely followed by the range top (44.30). An eventual close higher would mark a “higher high” more firmly neutralizing the mid-year technical breakdown.

Moving to U.S. sectors, the transports have broken out, rising amid easing crude oil prices, detailed Monday.

Specifically, the iShares Transportation Average ETF IYT, -0.31% has knifed to six-month highs, rising from a jagged, but successful, July retest of the 200-day moving average.

More broadly, the upturn punctuates a multi-month continuation pattern — illustrated on the three-year chart — placing the group’s record high, established Jan. 16, firmly within view.

Conversely, the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIH, +0.12% has broken down amid the August crude-oil price downturn.

Tactically, the breakdown point (24.80) is closely followed by trendline resistance (25.20).

An eventual close higher would neutralize the downdraft, though the group’s technical bias remains bearish pending such a move.

Moving to specific names, Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK, -0.36% is a large-cap carrier coming to life. (Yield = 2.0%.)

Technically, the shares have knifed to three-month highs, clearing the 200-day moving average. The breakout raises the flag to a primary trend shift.

Tactically, the breakout point closely matches the 200-day moving average, currently 64.60, and the recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.

Initially profiled June 25, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF, +0.94% has added 7.8% and remains well positioned.

Earlier this month, the shares gapped to two-year highs, rising from a cup-and-handle pattern defined by the April and July lows.

The subsequent pullback has been orderly, positioning the shares to build on the August spike. Tactically, the top of the gap closely matches the breakout point (46.10) and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.

Public since November 2017, SailPoint Technologies Holdings Inc. SAIL, -0.79% is a mid-cap developer of identity governance software solutions.

As illustrated, the shares have recently knifed to the range top, rising after the company’s second-quarter results.

The subsequent tight range signals muted selling pressure at resistance, improving the chances of eventual follow-through. Tactically, the prevailing range bottom (27.50) closely matches the top of the gap, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.

Universal Display Corp. OLED, -2.60% is a large-cap manufacturer of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies used in flat panel displays.

Earlier this month, the shares staged a strong-volume breakout, rising after the company’s quarterly results.

The ensuing flag pattern positions the shares to build on the initial spike. Tactically, a near-term floor matches the range bottom (114.40) and the recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dog-of-the-faangs-strategy-made-apple-a-winner-2018-08-20,"Apple’s stock price has been on a tear.

All you have to look at are the comments made by most analysts about two to three weeks ago; it becomes obvious that most were not expecting the strong move in Apple’s AAPL, +0.42% stock.

When I wrote that the next milestone for Apple stock would be $250, the shares were trading at $197.75. Since then the stock has risen by about $20. My call was not met with enthusiasm. Many were expecting the stock to pull back after earnings. Others sold shares on the news that Apple had reached a $1 trillion valuation.

Defensive measures for those who had just bought the stock and had small gains were needed because of a credible report out of China that Apple could become a pawn in the trade war. In spite of that threat, our call for long-term holders has been to continue to hold.

For the sake of full transparency, please click here to see the annotated chart of Apple that was published at the time of the call when Apple stock was trading about $20 lower from the recent high. Our call for a breakout has proven spot-on.

The Dog of the FAANGs

The Dogs of the Dow is a famous strategy.

But these days the market leaders are the FAANG stocks — Facebook FB, -0.32% Apple, Amazon.com AMZN, +1.48% Netflix NFLX, -1.29% and Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, +0.98% GOOGL, +1.02% I have not heard anybody talk about it, so I might as well coin the phrase “Dog of the FAANGs.” Let us explore the merits of the Dog of the FAANGs strategy with the help of a chart.

Chart

Please click here for an annotated chart comparing Apple to Netflix.

• The Dogs of the Dow strategy calls for annually buying the 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% stocks with the highest dividend yields.

• When applied to the FAANGs, this calls for buying Apple. An argument can be made that this line of thinking is flawed and dividends should be ignored in FAANG stocks because they are growth stocks.

• If you buy into the above argument against Apple, simply look at the comparison between Apple’s share price and Netflix’s share price.

• Netflix was the leader of the FAANG stocks based on price action until it reported earnings and the stock fell.

• The chart shows Netflix outperforming Apple by 25.8% at one point.

• Apple was a laggard among FAANG stocks based on price action.

• After earnings were released, Apple’s stock rose.

• As the chart shows, Apple has now outperformed Netflix by 20.7%.

• The chart proves that the Dog of the FAANGs has beaten the champion of the FAANGs.

Important takeaway

Ask yourself two questions. Has Apple all of a sudden become so much better as a company to justify the big share-price increase? Has Netflix all of a sudden become so much less of a company to justify the big share-price decline? If you have expertise in business valuations, your answer will be a resounding “no.” So what caused those two big stock moves? The answer is one word: sentiment.

At extremes, sentiment is a contrary indicator. When sentiment becomes overly positive, anyone who is likely to buy the stock would have already bought it. The slightest amount of selling can cause the stock to fall because there are not any buyers left. This is exactly what happened to Netflix when it reported earnings and concerns rose about user growth.

Going into earnings, sentiment on Apple was negative. Those who were going to sell had already sold. When earnings showed growth in services, buying pushed the stock much higher than would have been expected because there were no sellers left.

The takeaway is that in the short- to medium-term, sentiment often becomes the most important factor.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ignore-the-drama-at-tesla-and-focus-on-the-stocks-price-zones-to-make-money-2018-08-20,"There is a lot of drama at Tesla these days.

And there are dramatically divergent opinions about how much Tesla’s TSLA, -0.69% stock is worth. One technique that has helped The Arora Report over the years to consistently beat the market is to analyze various scenarios. In the case of Tesla, a scenario in which the stock is worth $1,000 is as plausible as a scenario in which Tesla is worth $60.

For those interested in making money by trading Tesla while controlling for risk, understanding price zones is important. Let’s explore with the help of a chart.

Read: Tesla short sellers are up $1.2 billion since Elon Musk’s ‘going-private’ tweet

Chart

Please click here for an annotated chart of Tesla. Please note the following:

• The chart shows that Tesla stock can trade in a very wide range in a very short time. This provides opportunities to make a lot of money in a very short time. It is extremely important to control for risk.

• When the price is above a line shown on the chart, the line is the support. When the price is below a line, the line acts as a resistance.

• The support/resistance lines shown on the chart are the traditional ways to enter a trade and control risk. For example, the stock may be bought when it approaches a support level with a stop just below the support line. This technique is widely practiced and widely taught.

• The problem with this traditional approach is that, these days, not only does it often not work, it generates losses more often than it generates profits. Unfortunately, those who do not vigorously test and observe continue to practice this technique, and gurus continue to teach this technique.

To learn more, please click here to see the Technical Analysis Screen of The ZYX Change Method.

• The reason this technique, which used to work but no longer does consistently, is the emergence of smarter players armed with algorithms. The smarter players can easily guess this typical behavior on the part of traders. They front-run this behavior often using algorithms with names such as “hunt and destroy.”

In a typical example, the stock is sold short before the support breaks, and the price is driven down, breaking the support level to take out the stops. Then the stock is bought at an artificially low price. When the stock jumps above the support line, many traders who have been taught the traditional way start buying the stock, pushing it higher. This allows an opportunity for algorithmic traders who bought low when the stops were taken out to take profits into the strength.

• In addition to the lines, the chart shows various support/resistance zones. Zones are the antidote to getting burned by the stock moving in your direction but only after your stops are taken out.

Getting whipsawed with stops is one of the biggest problems that many investors struggle with. We provide complete guidance to The Arora Report subscribers on how to use zones and also give precise zones in the signals we give.

Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.

• The chart also shows the most important zones. These zones are not only useful for short-term trading, but also for those who are taking long-term positions to scale in and scale out. One technique that can often double returns is to use trade-around positions around a longer-term core position.

These principles apply irrespective of if you are a Tesla bull or a Tesla short. Tesla is a popular stock just like Amazon AMZN, +1.48% Apple AAPL, +0.40% Facebook FB, -0.33% AMD AMD, -3.19% and Nvidia NVDA, +0.82% However, the trading pattern of Tesla is quite different.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/norway-oil-fund-gains-18-in-q2-led-by-amazon-2018-08-21,"Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, made a positive return of 1.8% on its investments in the second quarter of 2018 as higher global stock markets boosted its equity investments, it said Tuesday.

By overall sector, oil and gas companies were the strongest performers in the second quarter, thanks to higher oil prices in the wake of brisk demand and OPEC quota discipline.

Norges Bank Investment Management, the arm of the central bank that manages the so-called oil fund, said the annual return equated to 167 billion Norwegian kroner ($19.7 billion).

""North American and European stocks had a positive development in the quarter despite the prospect of increased trade barriers,"" said Norges Bank Investment Management Deputy Chief Executive Trond Grande.

However, the prospect of increased trade barriers and a weaker growth outlook in Europe, China and emerging markets as well as political uncertainty in Italy all limited stock market gains, it added.

The fund held 66.8% in equities, 30.6% in fixed-income assets and 2.6% in real estate at the end of the quarter.

The total value of the fund at June 30 was NOK8.337 trillion, and it noted that the depreciation of the krone against the U.S. dollar during the quarter increased the fund's value by NOK47 billion.

In individual stocks, NBIM said Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.48% made the biggest positive contribution to the fund's return in the quarter, followed by Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.42% and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA).

Banco Santander SA SAN, -0.10% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +3.34% and Banco Bradesco SA BBD, +0.86% made the biggest negative contributions, it said.

Equity investments returned 2.7% in the quarter, while unlisted real-estate investments returned 1.9% and fixed-income investments 0.0%, NBIM said.

The fund transferred NOK2 billion to the government in the quarter, but Mr. Grande said: ""In June, the fund had its first inflow since 2015. For the quarter as a whole we still had outflow.""

The oil fund was set up in the 1990s to convert Norway's vast oil wealth to global financial assets, partly to shield the country's budget from oil-price fluctuations.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-nvidia-chips-shift-the-future-of-gaming-graphics-2018-08-20,"Nvidia Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX graphics card.

Nvidia revealed at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany, its next-generation graphics technology that will power its newest gaming products powered by the Turing architecture.

New GeForce cards will forgo the “GTX” brand that the company has used for many years, instead moving to “RTX” for the high end of the market, indicating the dramatic shift in graphics technology the new GPU (graphics processing unit) represents. Just last week Nvidia NVDA, +0.80% announced professional graphics cards using the same Turing graphics architecture with the “Quadro RTX” name.

The move to RTX references an initiative at Nvidia to build products capable of real-time ray tracing. Ray tracing is a graphics rendering technique that simulates the interaction of light rays with physical objects to generate images. This allows developers and games to showcase the most life-like reflections, shadows and more. It differs dramatically from current rendering (called rasterization) that attempts to recreate these same effects with more efficient algorithms that less accurately simulate effects.

Nvidia is already the leader in graphics-chip share for the PC gaming market, and I expect that to lean further in its favor with this release.

Until this new generation of Nvidia graphics chips introduced performance acceleration for ray tracing, using it for real-time graphics in gaming was a nearly impossible feat. Modern movie effects are achieved with ray tracing, but require significant processing power and time. Nvidia is bridging the gap between what is possible in gaming and in movies.

Game developers are ready

While new features are introduced by graphics technology providers continuously with each new architecture, the advantage that Nvidia has today for the GeForce RTX series is the readiness of game developers to integrate the technology. Without games that use ray tracing, the feature could appear to be a gimmick.

Several of the largest game publishers were on stage with Nvidia to showcase their titles that already integrate ray tracing capability of improving graphics. Electronic Arts EA, +0.06% and its popular Battlefield franchise have adopted ray tracing for amazingly realistic surface reflections that show in reflective car finishes, windows and more from all light sources in the scene — not possible without ray tracing.

Square Enix and its Shadow of the Tomb Raider title also include ray tracing features for its September launch. The demo impressed with lighting and shadow combinations previously impossible in state-of-the-art game engines.

Price shows power of Nvidia

When recent Apple AAPL, +0.42% earnings indicated that the ASP (average selling price) of the iPhone had increased by more than $100 with the launch of the iPhone X, it showed that consumers are in a position to pay more, and are willing to pay more, for products deemed higher quality than the competition.

The new GeForce RTX cards have increased street prices relative to the same class of product from the previous generation. The flagship GeForce RTX 2080 Ti will run gamers nearly $1,200, a boost of $400 over the models launched two years ago. The RTX 2080 and RTX 2070 will run $800 and $600, respectively, a price bump of $200 each. I expect to see some initial pushback from the increase from vocal consumers, just as Apple saw with the pricing increase last year. But if gamers continue to buy up the technology that Nvidia is producing, then the prices will be justified.

As a result, I expect to see revenue and margins for the gaming segment of Nvidia’s finances to improve next quarter, assuming the available inventory of the GeForce RTX products is high enough to satisfy demand from the gaming community.

Nvidia will gain market share

Nvidia is already the leader in graphics-chip share for the PC gaming market, and I expect that to lean further in its favor with this release. Though the high end of the market (which these first RTX products are targeting) is small compared to the mainstream price segment, there is a strong buildup of demand for new gaming technology that could push more buyers into the higher price segments than in previous generations.

In the two years since the launch of Nvidia’s previous architecture, the industry has seen some wild swings. The cryptocurrency and bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.22% boom caused GPU prices to skyrocket as miners bought up all available inventory. As a result, many gamers were pushed out of the market, unable to find products in their budget, stalling sales. Now that crypto has died off, prices are dropping on existing product in the channel. Rumors of even faster, better products have kept buyers on hold, waiting to see what Nvidia would announce.

I have theorized around the problems Nvidia and AMD AMD, -2.99% might have once the crypto bubble burst and a significant number of used graphics cards flooded the market. This could still impact the sales of new products from both vendors. But Nvidia might have alleviated some of that by emphasizing the new ray tracing capability of the RTX line, pushing gamers who want the latest technology to rethink purchasing cheaper hardware from last generation.

How AMD could respond

Most agree that Nvidia had a lead in the graphics space from both a market and technology view. The launch of the GeForce RTX chips increases that even more, putting Nvidia in the driver’s seat for the foreseeable future.

This leaves AMD in a tough spot. Its current GPUs do not support acceleration engines for either ray tracing or artificial intelligence, leaving it a full step behind the capability that Nvidia can offer to gamers today. Though game developers are unlikely to lock any game titles behind a requirement for ray tracing, the more instances of games that integrate this added capability can create a rolling tide, putting more pressure on AMD to react.

AMD has no plans for a refresh to its consumer graphics product lines on its roadmap for 2018, so it is possible that Nvidia will maintain this technological advantage well into 2019.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-disneyland-changed-traveland-america-2018-08-14,"There’s a reason Disney employees are called cast members. It gives them a sense of belonging and reminds them that they’re putting on a show. Their job is to pass that onto their customers.

But behind the scenes, these cast members have also been fighting for higher wages. Disneyland Resort reached an agreement last month with union officials to increase the minimum wage it pays union-represented employees to $15 an hour by 2019, following an extended fight between the theme park and its workers over their salaries. A local initiative on the November ballot would force Disney to expand the wage to all 30,000 of its employees, and compel other businesses in Anaheim to up their minimum wages.

The wage hike will be the largest in the resort’s history, Josh D’Amaro, Disneyland Resort president, said in a statement following the agreement, adding that the company’s employees “are at the heart of making our guests’ dreams come true and this meaningful pay increase reflects the valuable roles they play at the resort.”

The smooth operation of Disney theme parks, after all, relies on those workers or cast members. When Disneyland opened, its first day in operation was a disaster. Many of the park’s attractions weren’t in working order yet. Restaurants ran out of food and water fountains ran dry. The line of motorists trying to get in stretched down the freeway in the sweltering Southern California heat.

But it didn’t take long for Disneyland to overcome that first disappointing day. Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, -0.28% first theme park has come to influence the tourism industry in ways big and small. Disneyland’s home of Anaheim is emblematic of Disneyland’s impact: Once a rural community known for its orange groves, it’s now a sprawling city in its own right, chock-full of hotels and motels.

Before Elon Musk founded Tesla TSLA, -0.67% and Steve Jobs helped revolutionize Apple’s brand AAPL, +0.42% there was Walt Disney. And he really knew how to put on a show to create a quintessential American brand. Here are six ways the theme park has already influenced travel and, crucially, spending:

Come rain or shine, Disney encourages patrons to keep shopping

Disneyland is arguably not just one of the country’s first theme parks, but also one of its first shopping malls, too. “Disneyland was, and still is, a mall,” James Farrell, the late professor of history and American studies at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, wrote in his book, ‘One Nation Under Goods.’ “It’s a mall — in the original sense of a pedestrian promenade — and it’s a shopping center too.”

When visitors first enter Disneyland, they stroll down Main Street U.S.A. Inspired in part by the hometowns of Hollywood set design Harper Goff (Fort Collins, Colo.) and Walt Disney himself (Marceline, Mo.), the architecture and decor of the gift shops and restaurants located on Main Street U.S.A. were meant to recreate the feeling of being in the downtown shopping district of a small American town around the turn of the century.

Disneyland was built almost concurrently with the first shopping mall in the United States, the Southdale Center in Indiana, which opened in 1956. Walt Disney’s views on urban design were very much inspired by the Southdale Center’s architect Victor Gruen.

Unlike most American towns, visitors could pass through the shops of Main Street U.S.A. without going outside. Because the shopping mall concept had not yet spread across America’s suburbs, Main Street U.S.A. was therefore the first time many consumers experienced walking from one store right into another indoors.



These days, shopping indoors may no longer be as unusual as it was back when Disneyland opened. But maintaining that design has its advantages: The air-conditioned shops provide a refuge from the Southern California heat, meaning guests still flock to these stores with wallet in hand.

Disneyland’s imprint can be seen on shopping malls and districts around the country. “There are tons of shopping districts that have taken the concept of old-timey America to create environment,” said Jim Hill, a theme park historian and blogger.

The Grove, the popular open-air mall in Los Angeles, seemingly borrowed from Disneyland with its vintage architectural style, complete with an electric trolley. And the country’s largest mall — the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. — has an amusement park inside.

Walt Disney was a televangelist—selling to parents and children alike

Walt Disney was something of a televangelist. He knew how to market to children and adults, and make sure both his message and products were passed from generation to generation. Before Disneyland first opened, Walt Disney hosted a series of television specials called “Walt Disney’s Disneyland,” which helped finance the theme park’s construction and fuel excitement for its opening. The park’s opening day was also captured in a live special, “Dateline: Disneyland.”

The Disney brand — like a toothpaste, football team or even religion — was passed down from parent to child. “Baby boomers grew up watching Disneyland be built up on TV, creating a group of emotional stockholders in the company,” said Jamie O’Boyle, senior analyst at the Center for Cultural Studies and Analysis, a research institute in Philadelphia.

The emotional connection that formed between the television audience and Disneyland soon morphed into a brand loyalty not unlike a religious conviction. And in that manner, a trip to Disneyland (and later Walt Disney World in Florida) was like visiting a place that was part shopping mall, part cathedral. “Disney created a place that people treated like a pilgrimage,” O’Boyle said.

In medieval times, Catholics would travel long distances to visit the nearest major town or city with an impressive cathedral. They wore special clothing and would bring back relics. They toured somber depictions of the Stations of the Cross, which O’Boyle likened to “the first dark ride” — the genre of amusement park rides that includes “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “The Haunted Mansion.”

A trip to Disneyland reflects those traditions. People dress in Disney-inspired clothing, collect trinkets and see the attractions. Even the focal point of the castle calls to mind the grandeur of cathedrals like Paris’ Notre Dame. The placement of both Disneyland and Walt Disney World even accounted for Americans’ ability to travel long distances by car, as both parks were located conveniently near major highways.

None of this comes cheap. Turning a trip to Disneyland or Walt Disney World into a pseudo-rite of passage for families has also allowed Disney to push the envelope in terms of charging tourists more each year to get to experience this pilgrimage. Earlier this year the park hiked admission prices by $7 to $117 for “regular” day prices. “Peak” tickets jumped $11, to $135. “Value” tickets remain at $97.

Disney helped pioneer dynamic pricing strategies to lure more customers

While the cost of a ticket to Disneyland has changed over the years, one thing hasn’t: Disney has always found clever ways to get guests to spend more money.

When Disneyland opened, admission was just $1 for adults and 50 cents for children — but guests had to pay additional fees to get tickets for the park’s rides. The cost of the ride tickets varied based on how thrilling or popular they were. Initially, these tickets were ranked on a scale from A to C, but the company later added more-expensive D and E tickets for new attractions. To this day, the most thrilling rides at theme parks are often referred to as “E ticket” attractions.

Starting in the 1980s, Disney began including rides in the admission price to its theme parks after other theme parks started to do so. But since then the company has found new strategies to get guests to spend more money. In particular, Disney has introduced ticketed events known as “upcharge options” where visitors can shell out for experiences like a $95 dessert party.

Recently, Disney offered guests the chance to get a sneak peek of the new Pixar Pier section of the Disney California Adventure theme park in Anaheim. Tickets to the six-hour event cost nearly $300, more than double the typical cost of admission. Other theme parks have copied this model: Universal Studios offered its first iteration of Halloween Horror Nights, its own separately-ticketed event, starting in 1991.

Over the years, Disney has also of course increased its prices. Last year, Disney introduced a tiered pricing structure, where the cost of admission to its American theme parks varies based on the time of year. As of February, a single day’s admission to Disneyland can cost as much as $135 for an adult, while a one-day ticket to the Magic Kingdom will set an adult visit back up to $129.

It introduced Americans to monorails so they would spend more money

Transportation was always in Disneyland’s DNA: Before Walt Disney set out to build the theme park, he created the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, a rideable miniature railroad located in the backyard of his Los Angeles home. And Disneyland Railroad was one of the park’s opening day attractions, shepherding guests in a scenic loop of the park.

Four years after Disneyland opened, the park entered the history books when the Disneyland Monorail began operation. At the time, the monorail on had one station. Nevertheless, it was the first active monorail built in North America. Walt Disney famously believed in monorails as the future of public transportation, including them as an element in his utopian vision of an American city, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.

Other Disney theme parks now have their own monorails. The monorail system at Walt Disney World is one of the largest in the world, and politicians even cite it as a model of a well-run public transportation system. While monorails never quite caught on as Walt Disney intended, more did crop up around the U.S.

Don’t miss: The chilling reason Walt Disney World got rid of ‘Do Not Disturb’ signs at some hotels

Travelers at airports — including those in Orlando and Newark — ride them to get to their terminals and, yes, monorails allow them to save both time and energy so they have more of both to shop at duty-free stores. In fact, visitors to Seattle and Las Vegas can hop on a monorail to visit major tourist attractions.

Disney has another motive behind keeping the monorails in operation. By providing guests to its resorts with easy transportation from their hotels to the theme parks, Disney reduces the likelihood that visitors will venture to other tourist attractions and take their money with them.

Disney was among the first companies to always keep selling

Blending fantasy and reality touches every aspect of a Disney vacation. At restaurants, you can dine while Mickey and Minnie walk around you. Walking down Main Street, you are serenaded by the Dapper Dans barbershop quartet singers. It creates an “experience” for fans, but it’s also an effective way of bombarding patrons with the brand. A man in a Mickey Mouse costume is a living, breathing (and walking) billboard. “Disneyland isn’t a passive place,” O’Boyle said. “It made entertainment much more interactive.”

Disneyland’s success in creating interactive environments has driven other tourist locations and industries to explore new ways to pump up the guest experience. Destinations ranging from Las Vegas casinos and major museums to even Broadway plays have sought to infuse interactive features and entertainment into their offerings.

But that too costs money. Those new features then become marketing fodder that will attract more visitors who will spend more money for an upgraded experience. “People don’t want to look at stuff in glass cases anymore — they want something you can engage with,” O’Boyle said.

It fueled the lucrative industry surrounding fan culture

Disneyland’s most profound effect has arguably been on the amusement park industry itself. While the park isn’t generally believed to be the first theme park — California’s Knott’s Berry Farm and Holiday World (previously known as Santa Claus Land) in Indiana jockey for that title — it certainly defined and revolutionized the concept.

One of the key ways Walt Disney did this was by incorporating pre-existing characters and stories into the park’s different sections and rides. “Walt took classic carnival rides and reinvented them,” Hill said. “Dumbo the Flying Elephant is really a ‘spinner’ attraction you can find anywhere, but it’s the characters that made it special.”

Existing characters and media franchises — intellectual properties, or IPs, in theme park lingo — are now inescapable. Universal Studios CMCSA, +0.06% has Harry Potter; Six Flags SIX, +0.40% has the characters from DC Comics and Looney Tunes; and Ohio’s Cedar Point FUN, -0.13% rollercoaster park has Snoopy and Charlie Brown.

New sections of Walt Disney World and Disneyland with a “Star Wars” theme will open next year. Disney is banking on the notion that the saga’s fans will pay a hefty sum to experience the world created by George Lucas, as “Harry Potter” fans did with Universal Studios’ offerings based on the entertainment franchise created by J.K. Rowling. The opening of an area themed after the film “Avatar” at Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando led it to jump one spot in the ranking of most-attended theme parks in the world from seventh to sixth in 2017, thanks to a 15.3% surge in visitors, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.

Some Disney theme park fans have resisted the shift toward incorporating film franchises into all of the company’s theme parks. In recent years, Disney has added rides based on films like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Frozen” to Epcot, which had previously been devoid of much influence from the company’s franchises. Some fans argued that this could take away from the educational experience that had long been central to the vision for the theme park.",2018-08-14,Disney

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-removes-25000-apps-from-its-app-store-in-china-2018-08-19,"BEIJING — Apple Inc. pulled illegal apps from its App Store in China after coming under fire from state media for not doing enough to filter out banned material.

“Gambling apps are illegal and not allowed on the App Store in China,” Apple said in a statement Monday. “We have already removed many apps and developers for trying to distribute illegal gambling apps on our App Store, and we are vigilant in our efforts to find these and stop them from being on the App Store.”

The removals were reported earlier by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday, which said 25,000 apps were pulled. Apple AAPL, +0.43% didn’t confirm that number. It offers more than 1.8 million apps in China, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Removing 25,000 apps would amount to about 1.4% of that total.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has recently been criticized by Chinese state media for having illegal apps in its store, as well as for not doing enough to filter banned content on its iMessage service. “Apple itself has set up the rules on how to allow apps onto its store, but it didn’t follow that, resulting in the proliferation of bogus lottery apps and gambling apps,” CCTV said in its report Sunday.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dorsey-says-twitter-isnt-the-arbiter-of-truth-doesnt-ban-users-for-their-views-2018-08-19,"Twiter Inc. is working to clean up its sometimes toxic atmosphere, Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said Sunday, although he did not commit to a timetable or specific policy changes.

Speaking to CNN’s Brian Stelter in an interview that aired Sunday, Dorsey said Twitter TWTR, -1.08% does not ban users for their political viewpoints, only for violations of the service’s rules — and it relies on its users to report those violations.

“We have not figured this out, but I do think it would be dangerous for a company like ours … to be arbiters of truth.” Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO

“We need to constantly show that we are not adding our own bias, which I fully admit is … more left-leaning,” Dorsey said. “But the real question behind the question is, are we doing something according to political ideology or viewpoints? And we are not. Period.”

Twitter came under fire recently for not suspending the account of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, even though companies such as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.43% , Facebook Inc. FB, -0.32% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +1.02% YouTube did block content from Jones and his website, Infowars, citing violations of their terms of service against hate speech, harassment and violent content.

Last week, Twitter blocked Jones from tweeting for seven days, and on Saturday, President Donald Trump slammed social networks for “totally discriminating” against conservatives.

Dorsey said Sunday that Twitter does not proactively police content on the service. “As we receive reports, we take action,” he said.

“People may say you should be a lot more proactive around all the content. And while we could do that, it just requires so many resources,” Dorsey added. As a point of comparison, rival social network Facebook has said it is in the process of adding about 20,000 people to monitor its content. Last month, Twitter posted its third straight quarterly profit.

Dorsey told CNN he was “ready to question everything” to improve Twitter. Among the potential changes are tweaking the way “likes” and follower numbers are shown, and allowing users to follow topics rather than just specific accounts.

“We are aware of some of the silos and how we’re isolating people by only giving them crude tools to follow accounts. We need to broaden our thinking and get more back to an interest-based network,” he said.

Twitter shares are down almost 25% over the past month, but are still up more than 36% year to date. As comparison, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% is up almost 2% in the past 30 days and 6% this year.",2018-08-19,Twitter

President Trump on Saturday threatened action against social-media companies, saying they were suspending accounts in a manner that was “totally discriminating” against conservatives.

Tweeting from his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., Trump said unnamed social-media companies were “closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others.”

“Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen,” Trump said. “Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police,” he continued. “Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!”

Social-media companies have faced criticism over bullying as well as false and abusive content on their platforms. Their efforts to rein in such content have also drawn fire, however, as critics say the services are censoring unpopular opinions.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-arm-designs-help-samsung-and-qualcomm-compete-with-apple-and-intel-2018-08-17,"New roadmaps released this week from Arm Ltd. detail the future of the company’s processor designs and show a shift in emphasis toward high performance.

The two main takeaways:

• These new cores (the building blocks of a CPU) will empower Android device makers and silicon providers like Samsung 005930, +0.54% SSNLF, -3.07% and Qualcomm QCOM, -0.50% to better compete with Apple AAPL, +0.41%

• The new cores also enable competitive solutions for the notebook space targeting Intel INTC, -0.22% Core-level performance. This should increase the opportunity to drive adoption of Arm-powered Windows devices.

Although not as well-known as Apple, Samsung or even Qualcomm, Arm is the company responsible for much of the intellectual property that powers mobile devices. Nearly all smartphones and tablets use Arm technology at some level, and this is the primary reason SoftBank SFTBY, -1.43% acquired Arm in 2016.

Arm is now the leader in low-power, highly efficient chip design, which led to its success in mobile. But as markets have shifted, the need for additional performance and upgraded user experiences became apparent.

The latest core is called the Cortex-A76, available today to silicon partners with end-user product availability predicted in late 2018 or early 2019.

Apple may lose its advantage

Apple is a customer of Arm and uses an “architecture license” that permits it to build its own custom cores and chips based on Arm IP. Apple has invested a tremendous amount of money and engineering to build its processors, starting with the Apple A6 used inside the iPhone 5 in 2012. It continued to iterate and advance its designs, and today has a noticeable performance advantage compared with competing Arm-based chips.

Arm’s advancements with its most recent core will finally allow competing vendors to offer competitive performance and capability without needing to invest the resources individually. The flagship partners in the space, Qualcomm and Samsung, have been slowly falling behind Apple in performance and benchmarks, and it appears that the Arm A76 will meet or exceed what Apple has built.

Arm’s pivot could result in some fundamental changes to the mobile market and the relative positions of Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm-based devices.

Intel will also be affected

This shift in direction for Arm will also affect Intel and its battle for the notebook space. New, faster cores and processor designs will enable partners like Qualcomm and its Snapdragon to battle Intel more directly, correcting the largest complaint about the platform: performance.

Arm is targeting Intel directly with this new roadmap, telling a group of analysts and partners that it will offer Core i5-level performance (Intel’s mid-range processor) while maintaining the power efficiency that has provided extended battery life in early waves of Windows-on-Arm devices.

Intel might struggle to counter this attack as it continues to have problems with its new 10nm (nanometer) production capability. The delays in the manufacturing division of Intel have caused problems throughout the company’s portfolio, but it is of particular importance when it comes to building chips with the characteristics necessary for low-power devices.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-cable-company-may-soon-provide-your-health-care-2018-08-16,"First, it was the tech giants. Apple Inc. APL, +7.41% with Apple Health. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.02% GOOG, +0.98% with Google Fit.

It was just a matter of time before traditional media companies decided they too wanted a piece of a market estimated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to be worth more than $3 trillion.

Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.06% which already provides broadband and networking solutions to health-care organizations, has been looking to expand its reach in the health-care space for some time. The company first got involved through Comcast Ventures, its venture capital arm, and then began collaborating with health care organizations on small projects. In 2015, Comcast worked with Kaiser Permanente Northwest to help launch the managed care company’s now-defunct My Pregnancy app, and in 2017, the cable giant collaborated with the University of California Davis to produce a series of health and nutrition videos.

Now, Comcast is working on a 50/50 joint venture with Philadelphia-based health insurer Independence Health Group, the parent of Independence Blue Cross.

The plan is this: Create a patient-centered digital platform that leverages Independence’s health expertise and Comcast’s direct connections with almost 60 million residential clients. The platform should theoretically help people take better charge of their health by providing an easy way to communicate with their medical providers, review what they need to do before and after operations and more.

Comcast and Independence’s relationship goes back decades. Comcast has been one of Independence’s largest customers since 1993, and Independence has invested in Comcast’s Ventures arm in the past. The two companies began volleying the idea of creating a digital health platform back and forth a couple of years ago, according to Don Mathis, general manager of growth at Comcast NBCUniversal.

“In health care, we saw a massive market,” he said.

Thanks to cord cutting, many media companies are concerned about growth, said Sri Velamoor, a partner at McKinsey who specializes in the digital health space. “These companies are looking at all of their assets and thinking: ‘How can we re-leverage this to drive growth in adjacent markets where our ability to engage consumers in their homes is a premium?’” he said.

Comcast isn’t the first media company to see potential in the health-care space. Cox Communications Inc. has also been exploring the space for several years. In 2015, Cox announced it was partnering with Cleveland Clinic to launch Vivre Health, a joint venture that would provide in-home health-care services via broadband. That same year, Cox acquired telehealth company Trapollo.

Vivre was supposed to help the cable and broadband company expand its reach into health care, but Cox eventually pulled out. “It was a mutual decision to move in a different direction,” a Cox spokesman told MarketWatch.

He said the company is focused on growing Trapollo, which provides remote patient monitoring services, something Mathis said Comcast is also considering doing in the future.

Comcast and Independence are still considering several models for generating income from their joint venture. A platform that helps people manage their health issues should cut costs in the long run, which should draw risk-bearing health plans, insurers and providers in as partners, said Brian Lobley, president of commercial and consumer markets at Independence Blue Cross.

But many hospitals and health systems already provide online portals patients can use to access their records and message their health-care providers, said Erik Gordon, clinical assistant professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. He is doubtful about big media’s ability to bring anything exciting or new to the space. Comcast and Cox are also looking at an increasingly crowded and competitive digital health space, he said.

“I probably get pitches from four or five startups a week,” said Gordon.

Also: India can teach the U.S. how to slash health-care costs by 40% — without rationing care

Despite the volume of digital health initiatives, there’s still no dominant player in the space, likely due to the complexities and many moving parts of the American health-care system, Gordon said.

In some ways, media companies are uniquely positioned to tackle the space, said Dan D’Orazio, CEO of health-care research firm Sage Growth Partners. The biggest issue facing digital health platforms is the lack of engagement. When it comes to hospital-specific patient portals, adoption rates have historically been low, hovering between 10% and 15%, he said. That’s something media companies may be equipped to change.

“If you think about the core competencies of a media company and how media has gone from traditional cable to cord cutting to over-the-top to mobile, these companies are experts — in theory — at reaching people and engaging people,” he said.

“They’ve been studying behavior and content for years. They have the infrastructure. They have a lot of intelligence in the area,” he said.

Tesla TSLA, -0.67% chief executive Elon Musk tweeted last week that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share, which would represent the largest stock buyout in history. He told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday night that he had no regrets about that tweet. The company has confirmed that it is considering the transition. Musk has since offered a fuller explanation about why he believed that he has “funding secured” to do this. (Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment.)

Also read: Did Elon Musk break any laws with his going-private tweet today?

Analysts remained confused as to Tesla’s reasoning for going private and questioned if it could line up the necessary funding to do so, and some doubted that the change would happen anytime soon. Others, including The Wall Street Journal columnist Charley Grant, argued that the move did not make sense for a company that has reaped the benefits of being publicly traded.

Some analysts say changes to Tesla’s corporate structure could have some trickle-down effects.

Musk could ship more low-cost Model 3s

The slow delivery of its Model 3 vehicles has been a sore subject for Tesla of late. The company’s delivery of the vehicle was described by some as “infamously behind schedule”, though in recent months the company finally hit production milestones for the car.

However, much of the developments surrounding the Model 3 have focused on higher-end versions of the vehicle, and not the low-cost $35,000 base model that was the calling card for the automaker. Some analysts argued the souped-up versions of the Model 3 were necessary to bring in much-needed revenue amid the production issues.

Going private could theoretically reduce some of those pain points for Tesla, and encourage it to ramp up production of those low-cost electric vehicles. It gives Tesla the ability to invest money in expanded facilities “without having the same kind of pressure for return on investments as public stockholders,” said Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for Autotrader. Tesla might also gain access to new financing sources after going private, she added.

Tesla may take longer to develop new products

A private Tesla could break out of the cycle that plague tech companies like Apple AAPL, +0.43% where investors and analysts expect new, successful iterations of products to come out on a frequent basis. The product pipeline is always “more flashy” than more mundane, if necessary, updates about improved manufacturing capacity, said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds. For this reason, he said the consumer impact of the company going private would likely be muted.

Musk has touted plans to create electric versions of roadsters and pickup trucks. But without the pressure to make something new as a public company, Tesla could take more time to develop its production capabilities in order to avoid the fiascoes that have defined the rollout of the Model 3. “Tesla has had a very independent trajectory unlike anything we’ve seen in the automotive industry thus far,” Acevedo added.

Buyers in some states may experience more trouble buying a Tesla

Consumers can only buy Tesla’s vehicles directly from the company — either online or at a Tesla showroom. As a result, Tesla does not have dealerships, nor does it employ salespeople paid on commission. That model has raised the hackles of dealership associations in many states. Some states, including Texas and Connecticut, have complete bans on direct auto sales. Others have limited Tesla’s sales in some manner. New York, for instance, restricted the number of showrooms Tesla can operate.

Tesla has worked to fight existing direct sale bans and prevent new ones from being put into effect. But the appearance of instability caused by the discussion of Tesla going private could make matters worse, said Hank Eskin, owner of Tesla resale website EV-CPO.com. An SEC investigation into the company, for instance, might give local lawmakers little reason to revise their laws in Tesla’s favor.

“Tesla might have more resistance from the car dealer associations because they might use this as an argument why Tesla can’t sell cars,” Eskin said.

If things go south, resale values could suffer — or improve

Brand identity is Tesla’s most important asset, according to Krebs, and, perhaps aside from some ill-judged tweets by Musk himself, it is also an industry leader in consumer perception, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla provides the most emotional attraction among all car manufacturers,” said Gregg Fidan, founder of RealCarTips.com. “Not only does it have luxury cachet, but also a genuine mission that speaks deeply to many people, which is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”

Ultimately, going private would relieve some of the scrutiny by investors, the public and those who have been shorting the stock. Musk referred to Tesla as “the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market” in his letter to employees regarding the possibility of being taken private. “Tesla has had to deal with a lot of manufactured negativity,” Fidan said. “When there are billions at stake, short-sellers will go to extreme lengths to ruin the image of the company they’re shorting.”

I recently wrote: “This S&P 500 chart shows the market is at a critical juncture.” Since then, I have received emails and phone calls from investors amazed at how the market ran up to the line shown on the chart in that story, fell and then rose right up to the line again.

After having witnessed firsthand the power of this simple chart, many have been asking for an update. So let’s explore with an updated chart.

Chart

Please click here for an updated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.10% It tracks the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% Please note the following from the chart:

• Market bulls are trying to beat the bears into submission.

• Bears look at the potential double top shown on the chart and stand their ground. A double top would be a big negative.

• The low volume shows that neither bulls nor bears have great conviction.

• The result of this bull-bear battle is a churning market.

• Often in a situation like this, the relative strength index (RSI) is a helpful indicator. In this case, RSI can go either way.

• Divergence in RSI from the last peak shows that momentum has waned. This favors bears.

• Not shown on the chart, but many other market internals we watch at The Arora Report, favor the bulls.

• The pattern looks different for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +0.44% and small-cap ETF IWM, -0.27%

Tiebreakers

As the market churns, the tiebreakers fall into the following three categories:

• The macro picture. On the positive side, trade war tensions are lessening. On the negative side, emerging market currencies are in turmoil.

• Fundamentals. The U.S. economy remains strong. Fundamentals in China are weakening. Please see “The biggest contagion risk to U.S. stocks isn’t Turkey — it’s an already-deteriorating China.”

• Market leaders. Walmart WMT, -0.16% is resurgent. There is strong buying in Apple AAPL, +0.43% Amazon AMZN, +1.48% is churning. There is selling pressure in Facebook FB, -0.32% Alphabet GOOG, +0.98% GOOGL, +1.02% Microsoft MSFT, +0.84% and Netflix NFLX, -1.31% The semiconductor group is deteriorating. Earning projections are poor from Nvidia NVDA, +0.81% and Applied Materials AMAT, -0.99% Intel INTC, -0.25% and Micron Technology MU, -1.87% are facing pricing pressure. AMD AMD, -3.07% remains a favorite of the momo crowd, but the smart money is selling it. Tesla’s TSLA, -0.67% stock is under pressure. Please see “Money flows of 11 popular tech stocks show Alphabet and Apple getting stronger.”

However, the biggest potential contagion is 14 times bigger than Turkey and deserves investors’ attention. Let us explore with the help of two charts.

Two charts

Please click here for the annotated chart of Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A ETF ASHR, -0.59% That’s an exchange traded fund for mainland China.

Please click here for the annotated chart of Chinese currency renminbi CNHUSD, -0.2859%

Please note the following:

• Gross domestic product (GDP) of China is more than 14 times bigger than that of Turkey. Any potential contagion emanating from China will have a significant impact on the U. S. stock market because of the size of the Chinese economy.

• Please note from the chart that in dollar terms, the mainland Chinese market has dropped 31% from its peak.

• Please note from the chart that the Chinese currency, renminbi, is approaching the key level of 7 renminbi to 1 dollar. If that level is decisively broken, the U.S. stock market may come under pressure.

• While the Chinese stock market and currency have been falling, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% — as represented by ETF SPY, +0.10% and Nasdaq ETF QQQ, +0.43% have ignored the developments in China. The reason is that investors in the U.S. are focused on popular stocks such as Apple AAPL, +0.41% Amazon AMZN, +1.46% and Facebook FB, -0.34% ; those stocks have been steadily rising, propping up the indexes. This is not likely to last if the Chinese stock market and currency keep dropping.

• The damage in the Mainland China ETF and iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -0.02% is nowhere near the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF’s TUR, -2.09% China is a completely different situation from Turkey.

What to do now

At The Arora Report we follow economic data from 23 countries. It is the situation in China that concerns us the most in terms of its impact on the U.S. stock market. The economic indicators in China are deteriorating fast. This does not mean that investors in the U. S. stock market should panic at this time. This is simply a call to be alert as the situation could worsen quickly.

The reason not to panic is that the Chinese economy is centrally controlled. The Chinese government has many levers that can be pulled to temporarily stop the deterioration.

We recently increased cash levels and hedges. We provide to The Arora Report subscribers precise levels of cash levels and hedges to hold as well as specific positions to buy, hold or sell. We are keeping a close eye on several important indicators related to China. In general, consider continuing to own good positions but hold higher-than-normal levels of cash and hedges. Also consider following a sophisticated model with a proven track record in both bull and bear markets. We follow the ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation Model with inputs in 10 categories.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crazy-rich-asians-actors-hope-films-success-will-open-more-doors-for-asian-americans-2018-08-15,"Ken Jeong had a moment on the set of “Crazy Rich Asians.”

It was during the filming of the final scene of the movie, which takes place on the rooftop of Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands hotel.

He looked around at the majority-Asian cast and, for the first time on a film set, “really felt at home,"" he said.

“Crazy Rich Asians” is the first studio movie in years to have a predominantly Asian-American cast. Buzz has been mounting since the official trailer was released in April, and the movie has been a hit with critics, with a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film opens in theaters on Wednesday.

Jeong recalled the moment during a TimesTalks panel on Tuesday evening moderated by New York Times contributor Logan Hill.

“All of us, even if we didn’t know each other, had parallel struggles as Asian-American actors. Playing the sidekick, playing the supporting [role],” Jeong said. “I found fellowship in that.”

His fellow “Crazy Rich Asians” actors Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh and the book’s author Kevin Kwan, who were also on the panel, nodded.

Yeoh, who has starred in many hits on both sides of the Pacific, said she hopes the movie will open the door to more opportunities for diverse storytelling in Hollywood.

“I hope this isn’t just going to be a trickle,” she said. “This will be a stream that leads into a tsunami of what needs to be represented in the right way.”

The cast also discussed what it was like to shoulder the first majority Asian-American studio film in years.

“If we mess up somehow, it does have an effect, it does have a backlash. It’s not fair, but that’s the way it is,” said Awkwafina.

She also feels a responsibility to her community because “how we are represented in the media directly affects how we get treated in real life,” she said. “If all that we are on the screen are the minstrel, the side kick, the funny guy, whatever, that’s how we are treated, that’s how they see us,” she said.

Audiences and industry professionals hope a success story for “Crazy Rich Asians” will prompt studios to take on more projects featuring Asians in lead roles. Apple recently acquired the rights to “Pachinko,” the epic novel by Min Jin Lee about four generations of a Korean immigrant family, and Amazon Studios is working with Kwan on a new drama series.

“I have twin daughters, 11 years old,” said Jeong. “To see very strong Asian female characters—it definitely has an impact on my family.”

“May they continue to see more of that,” he added.

The film comes as audiences increasingly call on Hollywood to address the longstanding lack of diversity on the big screen.

The rom-com, distributed by AT&T-owned T, -0.37% Warner Bros., was initially tracking to post a $20 million opening weekend in the U.S., but the most recent estimates show it’s on pace to top $26 million during its initial five-day run, according to Variety. The Jon M. Chu-directed adaptation of Kwan’s frothy best-seller had a budget of $30 million.

“Crazy Rich Asians” follows economics professor Rachel Chu (Wu) as she accompanies her boyfriend Nicholas Young (Golding) to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore. There, she finds out from her friend Peik Lin (Awkwafina) and Lin’s father (Jeong) that he’s from one of the wealthiest families in Singapore.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/america-first-us-stock-market-outpaces-global-competitors-2018-08-16,"For all the talk of how America’s protectionism may sink this bull market in stocks, it’s still very much “America first” on Wall Street — at least as far as equities are concerned.

As Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners recently pointed out, the median return among the major country-specific ETFs is minus 4% in 2018, with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% posting a 6% gain. Only Saudi Arabia and Norway have performed better, with 17% and 9% returns, respectively.

It’s not only obvious duds like Turkey either, which has been cratering on renewed fears of a currency crisis; the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF TUR, -2.09% has been cut roughly in half compared with its January highs. Other struggling nations include developed markets like Japan and the U.K.

Bigger picture, data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that of 22 major regional ETFs, 16 are in “long-term downtrends” with three more displaying a “neutral” trend. The lone uptrend is found in the iShares Global 100 ETF IOO, +0.16% a diversified fund that conspicuously includes U.S. mega-caps like Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.41%

This strength of American equities vs. the rest of the world is not to say Trump’s trade war is certain to resolve favorably for the typical U.S. worker, mind you. Neither is it proof that it’s wise for investors to forgo geographic diversification to chase America’s hot hand in the stock market.

That said, an objective look at the situation both at home and in five key foreign markets reveals things are quite strong for the U.S. and quite weak for the rest.

U.S.

• 2018 return: 6% for SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.09%

What’s not to like? Second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth hit 4.1%, the fastest rate in about four years, thanks to strong consumer metrics. And June’s consumer spending numbers released at the end of July showed continued power and included an upward revision to May’s figures.

In fact, the only headline risk seems to be a rapidly expanding economy that may be sparking moderate inflation and emboldening the Federal Reserve on its course to normalize interest rates. If the worst thing we can say about America right now is that the recovery has matured to this point, it’s no wonder investors are piling in.

Eurozone

• 2018 return: minus 6% for the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF VGK, +0.02%

When comparing nominal GDP, the European Union is collectively just a few trillion bucks behind the U.S. economy. And while there was some cheerleading on the other side of the Atlantic last year about how the eurozone economy was improving, including outpacing U.S. growth for two years running, that optimism has gone up in smoke in 2018. Trade tensions and labor woes have weighed on EU manufacturers in the first quarter, resulting in GDP growth of less than a 2% annual rate.

Headwinds only seem to be mounting, too, given the trouble in key trade partner Turkey as well as incredibly weak industrial production in its second-quarter GDP details.

China

• 2018 return: minus 9% for the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -0.02%

The world’s No. 2 economy by nominal GDP, China should be a part of almost every investing portfolio regardless of your strategy. That said, Chinese equities — particularly the large-cap companies most U.S. investors are familiar with, such as telecom giant China Mobile CHL, +0.84% and Sinopec SNP, +1.01% — are suffering mightily this year.

In fact, the declines have been so severe that after its domestic stock market has lost trillions in value since Jan. 1, it is now no longer the second-largest equities venue in the world as Japan leapfrogged it to reclaim that title. Trade wars and tariffs are largely to blame, though investor uncertainty is more of a drag than any tangible impact. Second-quarter GDP growth of 6.7% was the slowest since 2016. From a sentiment perspective, threats of a trade war couldn’t have come at a worse time for Chinese stocks.

Japan

• 2018 return: minus 4% for the iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.21%

Just because Japan is a bit more stable than China, let’s not presume this means the Land of the Rising Sun is sitting pretty. After a rosy 2017 that showed some of its best economic expansion in years, first-quarter GDP was a stunner — contracting at a 0.6% annualized rate, three times worse than forecast.

The details are even worse than the headline, with declines in both investment and consumption, along with the tell-tale decline in export growth that is a hallmark of the global economy amid trade tensions.

Economists have been quick to note that the contraction doesn’t’ mean a recession is in the works. But barring a significant change in current trends for capital expenditures and consumer spending, it’s safe to say the rest of 2018 isn’t looking particularly bright for Japan.

United Kingdom

• 2018 return: minus 6% for the iShares MSCI United Kingdom Index ETF EWU, +0.00%

The U.K. is worth exploring separate from the broader eurozone because, after all, apparently this nation is on a path to independence from the EU.

But perhaps not, given the continued political mess that has most foreign policy experts highly skeptical that any functional deal is going to be easily achieved by the EU Council in October. In fact, the U.K. foreign minister has been increasingly vocal about the risk of a chaotic “no-deal” Brexit where no formal trade relationship exists and countless economic barriers and miles of red tape would suddenly apply.

If markets hate uncertainty in general, you can imagine what this means for the U.K. economy and equities domiciled there. Shares of the EWU U.K. fund were actually slightly in the green as recently as mid-June — right around the two-year mark of the initial Brexit vote, in fact. But the disarray around Brexit is taking its toll on both investors and on businesses, as evidenced by the nation’s recent “manufacturing recession.”

India

• 2018 return: minus 3% for the iShares MSCI India ETF INDA, -0.58%

While the nation has a very low per-capita income, India is neck-and-neck with the U.K. in regard to nominal GDP output. And particularly as China’s economy matures, India has been one of the largest growth centers for global economic expansion.

However, despite a red hot growth rate of 7.7% in the first quarter — up from 7% at the end of 2017 — the largest and most liquid India-focused ETF is in the red this year, and down even more sharply from its January highs.

Part of that is because of U.S. policy decisions, including both trade tensions as well as tighter central bank policy that is causing a flight of capital from emerging markets. But it’s also because the red-hot growth has not come without challenges, including inflation that hit a five-month high of 4.9% in June and has subsequently resulted in the second rate hike from the Reserve Bank of India this year to a benchmark rate of 6.5%. It’s not quite a currency crisis on par with Turkey, but serious inflation challenges have caused the rupee to slump and make it Asia’s worst-performing currency so far in 2018.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tencents-dive-erases-175-billion-from-market-cap-2018-08-16,"The shine is off Asia's market darling.

Tencent Holdings Ltd. shares fell as much as 5% on Thursday in Hong Kong after the Chinese tech giant reported its first quarterly profit drop in more than a decade. The selloff extended a rout that has wiped out more than $175 billion of the company's market value since January.

The underwhelming performance by the world's largest videogame publisher by revenue left many Wall Street analysts red-faced. Nearly all the equity research analysts that cover Tencent have buy-related recommendations on the stock, which recently traded 32% below its average price target, according to FactSet.

""We have been entirely blindsided by these most recent results, for which we apologize,"" Douglas Morton, head of research for Asia at brokerage Northern Trust Capital Markets, said in a note after the company fell far short of his profit estimates.

Calling Tencent's results the ""worst in recent memory,"" Mr. Morton said the poor numbers could even be the catalyst for a further selloff across emerging markets, despite Tencent having little to do with the Turkish currency-related turmoil that has roiled riskier markets around the world this month.

Tencent, which owns China's highly popular social-messaging app WeChat, a day earlier reported a 2% decline in second-quarter income to 17.9 billion yuan ($2.6 billion). Its revenue rose 30% to 73.7 billion yuan, but that also missed most analysts' forecasts. The company said its games business has been hindered by a regulatory restructuring of two Chinese government agencies that oversee videogame content, leading to delays in game approvals.

The company's stock price has dropped 12% this week alone. The shares, which recently traded at 326.20 Hong Kong dollars ($41.56), are now down by nearly a third from their record high in January, when Tencent's market capitalization climbed to $572 billion and surpassed that of U.S. social-media giant Facebook Inc.

The selloff has sparked fears of whether there will be broader contagion for tech stocks around the world. U.S.-listed Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. also fell on Wednesday, pushing deeper into negative territory for the year.

Investors have long bet on technology transforming people's lives around the world, with the largest companies being the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. For years this has been a winning trade. A fund-manager survey released earlier this week by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the so-called FAANG quintet of Facebook, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. as well as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent remained the most crowded trade in August for a seventh straight month.

But tech has wobbled of late, including Facebook's sour earnings report last month, which prompted the biggest-ever one-day loss in market value for a U.S.-listed company.

The NYSE FANG+ Index, a closely watched tech index which includes Alibaba and Baidu as well as several U.S. tech giants, fell 1.6% on Wednesday, its worst one-day decline so far this month. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is on the verge of a bear market, down nearly 20% from a Jan. 26 high.

Tencent and its biggest shareholder, South African media and internet firm Naspers Ltd., are also large components of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. Naspers fell 8.2% on Wednesday, its worst one-day drop since December 2007.

Although analysts are starting to dampen their optimism on Tencent, many still have rosy outlooks and are keeping their buy recommendations and lofty price targets on what remains the most valuable company listed in Asia.

Mr. Morton of Northern Trust, who has on multiple occasions this year advised clients to buy Tencent shares when they were tumbling, said he thinks the long-term outlook for the stock is still positive. ""We remain buyers (albeit with humility),"" he said.

Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has nailed its 2,802 breakout point — tagging an early-Wednesday low of 2,802.5 — while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently ventured under key trendline support.",2018-08-15,

While the Turkish lira TRYUSD, -2.4553% is continuing to recover, Recep Erdogan & Co. are ramping up their tariffs on American goods. Turkey’s leaders describe today’s move as “retaliation for the conscious economic attacks by the United States.”

But this geopolitical angst hasn’t been doing that much for gold GLD, +0.31% , which is trading around levels last seen in January 2017. And that brings us to our call of the day from A Wealth of Common Sense’s Ben Carlson, who suggests that the safety play’s future isn’t so bright.

“I don’t think you can rule out the possibility that gold’s GCU8, -0.37% value to society could be called into question in the decades ahead,” Carlson writes at his blog.

What’s the problem? He points to the disruption-minded tech sector and suggests that post-boomer generations might not take as much of a shine to the metal.

“Isn’t it possible faith in gold could potentially die out with the older generations?” asks Carlson, who is Ritholtz Wealth Management’s director of institutional asset management. “Doesn’t technology present a massive risk to gold’s standing as a store of value going forward?”

The idea could be that Silicon Valley is providing other vehicles for hoarders.

Yet he isn’t gaga over cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.22% , which has been called “digital gold.” His take on cryptos: “It’s going too far in the other direction to assume bitcoin or something similar will completely replace gold.”

Carlson also expects resistance to his musings: “Cue the hate mail from the gold bugs.” And he does throw the metal’s fans some bones.

“I understand some of the reasoning behind the fact that people still put a lot of faith in the yellow rock — it’s survived as a store of value for thousands of years and can act as an uncorrelated asset,” he writes.

The chart

Jeff Hirsch The current bull run began in February 2016 and has to run until 2023 to set records, Hirsch reckons.

“Hold the champagne! This is not the longest bull market on record or since WWII, as the current buzz on The Street would have you believe,” writes Stock Trader’s Almanac editor Jeff Hirsch as he provides our chart of the day.

See: The bull market is set to become the longest in history

Investors should consider using Ned Davis Research definitions for such things, Hirsch says in a post at his Almanac Trader blog. By that shop’s rules, a bull market requires a 30% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days, or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days.

That has Hirsch declaring: “Using Ned Davis rules, the longest bull began on Oct. 11, 1990, and ran for 2,836 calendar days until July 17, 1998. The current bull that began on Feb. 11, 2016, would have to run until Nov. 17, 2023, to beat it.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/turkey-increasingly-aligns-with-russia-as-us-sanctions-sour-relations-with-west-2018-08-15,"ISTANBUL—President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey stepped up his attacks on the U.S. on Tuesday, calling for a boycott of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.41% iPhones and other U.S. electronic goods, while his foreign minister joined his Russian counterpart in criticizing Western sanctions.

Turkey, a longtime North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, has been caught between the West and Russia. This week, officials in Ankara were leaning decidedly toward Moscow.

In recent weeks, Turkey and Russia have been the targets of U.S. sanctions while their currencies, the lira and the ruble, have dropped against the dollar. Erdogan’s boycott is part of a wider campaign Turkey has launched to retaliate against the U.S. measures.

The lira, already hit by investor concerns over Turkey’s financial stability, has hit a series of record lows since Aug. 1, when the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkey for not freeing a U.S. pastor facing terrorism charges.

New tariffs the U.S. introduced on some Turkish imports on Monday have raised concerns of a full-blown trade war.

Attending a conference with Russia’s top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, in Ankara on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey lashed out against Western sanctions.

“This era when we are being bullied must end,” Cavusoglu said.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-reportedly-blocks-alex-jones-from-tweeting-2018-08-14,"Twitter Inc. has blocked right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from tweeting for a week, according to reports Tuesday night.

According to multiple reports, Jones’s personal account was placed in read-only mode for seven days, apparently over a video urging his followers to get their weapons ready. While not a suspension, which would keep him off Twitter entirely, the move does not allow him to post tweets or retweet, like or comment on others’ tweets. Jones has about 889,000 Twitter followers.

A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Jones’s account had been restricted, and that he was required to delete a tweet linking to a video that was in violation of Twitter rules.

A Buzzfeed reporter tweeted Tuesday night that the tweet that got Jones into trouble with Twitter linked to a video on Periscope, which Twitter owns. While Jones apparently took down the tweet, Media Matters preserved the video, in which Jones calls on his followers to prepare for violence. In the video, Jones urges his supporters to get “battle rifles” ready to fight “antifa,” the mainstream media and “Chicom operatives.”

Last week, Jones’s Infowars content was removed from a number of major platforms, including Facebook Inc. FB, -0.34% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +1.00% GOOG, +0.93% YouTube, as well as Spotify SPOT, -0.49% and Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.41% podcasts. The companies cited violations of their terms of service against hate speech, harassment and violent content. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said last week that his company did not suspend him because Jones had not broken any of its rules..

Twitter has faced blistering criticism for years over its inability to crack down on harassment and violent speech, as well as for its role in spreading misinformation. The company has said on a number of occasions that it was working to curb abusive behavior on its service, including in May, when it announced actions against “troll-like behavior,” as well as a bot purge in July.

Here are the biggest takeaways on the new U.S. trade deal with Mexico: (1) The deal would require that 75% of the parts in any car sold in North America to be made in the U.S. or Mexico. Currently, about 62% of the parts are required to be produced in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. This component is a blow to China, which shouldn't come as a surprise; (2) the deal would require that 40% to 45% of auto parts inside of cars are to be made by high-wage U.S. workers, in this case those earning $16 an hour or more.

It's a nice win for Donald Trump's base, and discount stores such as Walmart (WMT) and Dollar General (DG) (think about it). All in all, the market can now be called a wild beast. Mr. Market is eating up strong profit outlooks from companies, rising earnings estimates from Wall Street and the notion that Trump is winning on trade. Run free you beast, run free ... for now.

Meanwhile, about those Best Buy earnings...

Thank you, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) . The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, known as the SOX Index, has finally broken out to the upside after a stretch of weakness. The SOX Index has gained for five straight sessions, up almost 3% during that span vs. the Nasdaq's 1.6% gain.

Gains were broad-based on Monday, and led by euphoric sentiment around AMD's new chips.

For market bulls, the SOX breakout is a positive sign (as is the increasingly healthy market breadth).

Around TheStreet

The Dana (DAN) team came down for a chat with me Monday afternoon. Nothing like chatting about truck axles and NAFTA to get the week started off on the right foot. Anyway, CEO of the 115-year auto parts maker, Jim Kamsickas, told me the new U.S. trade deal with Mexico is a ""big deal."" Since details of the deal are limited right now, Kamsickas was hesitant to say his company's sales and profit margins would get a boost.

Kamsickas made a strong pitch to me though that the stock is undervalued. After studying the company's numbers the past week, it's hard to argue that even considering weakness in the passenger car markets and vanishing platform programs from Ford (F) .

On the other hand, Google's Pixel 3 and 3 XL should, like the Pixel 2 and 2 XL before them, be differentiated when it comes to software. And if Google, which reportedly plans to unveil its newest Pixels on October 9th, also lines up a larger set of carrier partners this time around, that should allow Pixel sales to grow a little more within a flatlining smartphone market.

Much like the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL are expected to have virtually identical features outside of their display and battery sizes. Photo leaks indicate the devices will feature iPhone X-like top notches, and (like Apple and Samsung's flagships, but unlike prior Pixels) feature glass backs rather than aluminum ones.

Glass backs make it easier to support wireless charging, a feature that (judging by a leaked video) Google will be supporting this time around. In addition, the third-gen Pixels will reportedly ship with a pair of wired headphones that feature a button for launching Google Assistant. As usual, Google's phones will be powered by a flagship Qualcomm (QCOM) processor (in this case, the Snapdragon 845).

Notably, though the Pixel 3 and 3 XL will reportedly have dual front cameras that are said to enable a ""Super Selfie"" feature, they're expected to have just a single rear camera. In that respect, the phones are quite the outlier at a time when dual rear cameras have become the norm for high-end phones, and some OEMs have even begun launching phones with three rear cameras.

To be fair, with the help of machine learning algorithms and proprietary image-processing chip known as the Visual Core, Google did a very good job with the Pixel 2's sole rear camera, as reviews make clear. And some sample photos claimed to be taken by a Pixel 3 XL suggest that little will be changing on that front this year. Nonetheless, by not having a second rear camera, Google is unable to do things such as dedicate a camera to wide-angle shots or support optical zoom.

The Pixel 3 also reportedly comes up a little short in some other hardware areas. Google is once more expected to use LG's OLED panels for its displays rather than Samsung's, which are used by both Apple and Samsung's flagship phones are generally considered best-in-class. Photo leaks indicate the phone's top notch is larger than the iPhone X's, and that it also has a sizable bottom bezel. And whereas Samsung put a giant 4,000mAh battery inside the Galaxy Note 9, the Pixel 3 XL reportedly features a 3,430mAh battery, which would be slightly smaller than the Pixel 2 XL's.

But these hardware limitations might not necessarily be deal-breakers for Pixel fans who have come to love its software feature set. This feature set includes a streamlined user interface that contrasts with the more bloated UIs on some rival Android phones, quick access to Android updates and a superb camera app.

It's also worth keeping in mind that to date, Pixel sales have been hampered by a pretty limited set of distribution partners in the U.S. and elsewhere. Though the Pixel 2 and 2 XL work on the networks of all of the top-4 U.S. carriers, only Verizon (VZ) sells the phones through its physical and online stores. In the U.K., EE is the only carrier to do so.

With Samsung having made fairly incremental updates to its Galaxy S and Note lines this year, just adding a few more large carrier partners could be enough for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL to meaningfully outsell their predecessors. Even if an unspectacular hardware feature set and a sluggish high-end smartphone market prevents the phones from seeing blockbuster sales.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/27/2018/china-calling-why-alphabet-starbucks-cant-keep-their-eyes-china,"China Calling: Why Alphabet, Starbucks Can't Keep Their Eyes Off China

Despite unproductive trade talks in Washington, China's market is proving an irresistible magnet for American companies looking to grow.

For many of these companies, the wheels to expand in China have been in motion for some time, but recent trade tension and uncertainty have not dissuaded them, so far.

Starbucks along with Yum! Brand, Inc. (YUM) , Nike (NKE) and Tapestry Inc (TPR) , the umbrella brand for Coach and Kate Spade, are all looking to developing markets to provide growth on the international level, says Brian Yarbrough, an analyst for Edward Jones, in an interview with Real Money.

Yum! China plans to more than double its number of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants.

""For most consumer discretionary companies, there are not a lot of growth opportunities domestically,"" says Yarbrough, noting ""trade concerns have of course thrown a little bit of cold water on China's market right now.""

Still, the alluring combination of demographics and projected growth is too strong to ignore for many of U.S. brands.

Starbucks' Partnership with Alibaba

Last week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) , China's Internet giant, shared more details about its partnership with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) , the American coffee retailer, as both angle to take advantage of China's fast-growing middle class.

Alibaba CEO said its American partner plans to ""transform Starbucks China into a digital operation.""

For Starbucks, China represents its most digitally advanced, profitable stores in the world.

Starbucks has a 58.6% share of the market in China, according to Euromonitor data, and is opening a store there every 15 hours.

""Starbucks' newest class of stores in China are delivering the highest average unit volumes, return on investment and profitability of any of the market's prior store classes in its history,"" according to the company.

And China's middle class is projected to keep growing and to keep spending.

China's middle class could spend $3 trillion more by 2022, one of the fastest-growing n the world, according to a study by Brookings Institution on the global middle class.

With Starbucks' growth slowing in the U.S., China simply presents too good of an opportunity to pass on.

Over the next five years, the Starbucks ready-to-drink business in China is expected to expand to more than 400 major Chinese cities.

Alphabet's Push

Waymo, Alphabet's (GOOG) driverless car unit opened a China subsidiary in Shanghai back in May, according to a filing to China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. Chinese news site Guancha first reported the news, also saying the company may bring self-driving taxi service to China by the end of 2018, in addition to designing and testing autonomous vehicle parts in China.

Before that, Alphabet launched AI research lab in Beijing last year. The company also launched an AI-powered game called 'Caihua Xiaoge', in which the user draws and the AI guesses what it is. The game became a hit.

And most recently, Alphabet is also planning to relaunch a friendly version of Google search engine, which is code-named Dragonfly and is facing criticism from Google employees.

Slow Trade Talks

Not much has come out of the talks in Washington, with new series of tariffs looming on the horizon.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has taken a proactive approach to supporting the yuan. This month the banks resumed adjustment of the yuan pricing against the dollar to ward off devaluation.

""If the guidance is not heeded by the market, there might be follow-up policy actions to imprint the guidance on the market,"" said Goldman Sachs in a research note on Saturday.

How long can the Chinese government prop up the yuan against the dollar and avoid further devaluation and outflow of capital?

China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs is another risk that all U.S. companies operating in China face.

As Duncan Clark points out in his book Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built, the last time China suffered a major economic crisis in 2008, it actually worked out well for companies like Alibaba, with a major market share.

""China's traditional export markets were thrown into a tailspin,"" he wrote. ""Taobao pried open the factory gates to consumers in China instead.""

Together with Tmall, e-commerce site Taobao makes up 86% of Alibaba's total revenue.

The U.S. companies are counting that the Chinese government will do whatever it takes to keep the economy churning along and its fast-growing consumer base happy.

In 2008, the Chinese government policies ended up boosting e-commerce companies like Alibaba.

""It became clear that the much-needed rebalancing of the Chinese economy toward consumption could no longer be postponed,"" Clark wrote. ""And Alibaba is one of the biggest beneficiaries.""

Wall Street Overview

Stocks closed higher on Monday Aug. 27, after the U.S. and Mexico reached a tentative trade deal.

The agreement would replace NAFTA, the trade pact between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The deal will be called the United States-Mexico Trade agreement, according to President Trump.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 259 points, or 1.01%, to 26,049. The S&P 500 rose 0.77% to 2896.71, its second record high in as many trading days. The Nasdaq gained 0.91% to end at 8,017.90, also a record.

Monday's gains built on Friday's session which saw both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at all-time highs after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech that the U.S. economy was strong and that ""further gradual increases"" in interest rates were ""appropriate"" if ""strong growth in income and jobs continues.""

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares fell 1.6% on Monday after the electric vehicle company led by CEO Elon Musk said Friday it wouldn't be going private. ""Over the past several weeks, we put in place a process led by a Special Committee of the Board to evaluate a proposal Elon was considering to take Tesla private. Yesterday, we held a Board meeting, during which Elon reported on the work he and his advisors have been doing in connection with this effort,"" said a post on the company's website. ""Elon communicated to the Board that after having done this work and considered all factors, he believes the better path is to no longer pursue a transaction for taking Tesla private. After discussing this, we dissolved the Special Committee. The Board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla's operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward."" Musk wrote: ""I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable."" Musk sent Twitter ablaze on Aug. 7 by tweeting that funding for a deal to take Tesla private at $420 had been secured. Tesla closed Friday at $322.82. Tesla Bull Says Company's Fundamentals Are Still 'Underappreciated'

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) reportedly has been developing a system that would direct new users to sign up for the streaming company's subscriptions outside of its apps that run on Apple Inc. (AAPL) devices, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move would spare Netflix the need to pay the commission Apple has charged on such transactions over its devices, which are typically 30%, according to the Journal. Netflix rose 1.7%.

Arconic Inc. (ARNC) , the aluminum products maker, slipped 0.8% on Monday after jumping on Friday following a Reuters report that said the company had expanded the scope of its potential sale to include the whole company just weeks after it put its building and construction unit up for sale.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) fell 2% on Monday after the pharmaceutical giant reported positive Phase 3 results for its drug, tafamidis, which reduced the risk of death for patients with a rare and fatal heart disease by around 30%.

The announcement of a renewed trade deal with Mexico is helping extend a market rally and lifting FAANG stocks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 1%, rising to 26,048.34 at 1:40 p.m.

""A big deal looking good with Mexico!"" tweeted President Trump today, which was followed by a press conference in which the president called the deal probably ""the biggest ever.""

A reversal of tone from the constant talk of trade and tariffs with China appears to be boosting market sentiment as the market continues its bull run today with the Dow topping 26,000 and the Nasdaq Composite crossing the 8,000 mark.

Nasdaq's technology sector rose 1% on Monday to the highest level in over two weeks.

Carrying over the momentum are FAANG stocks, as each of the entities which includes AAP holding Facebook, Inc. (FB) .

Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG) , Amazon.com (AMZN) , Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) , and Apple, Inc. (AAPL) posted gains today in the range of 0.7 to 2.8%.

""The market is up about 1% and the FAANG stocks are all up around that range,"" Michael Pachter, equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, explained. ""It's not too weird to think they're moving along with the market.""

Facebook shares are up 1.67% to $177.56 per share. While the modest gain is positive, the stock is still tending toward the lower end of its 52 week range of $149.02 to $218.62.

Many analysts and investors remain concerned about Facebook's outlook.

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/netflix-faces-growing-competition-14692733,"Admit it: You were a Netflix (NFLX) junkie once.

Maybe it was ""House of Cards"" that got you hooked, or ""Stranger Things"" -- or maybe it was that weekend you watched 14 hours of ""Storage Wars"" while getting over the flu. Either way, there's a good reason why Netflix is synonymous with binge-watching: The streaming powerhouse was the first to popularize ad-free, quality streaming video by subscription. Fast forward to today, and 'Netflix and chill' is practically a national pastime.

But Netflix isn't the only game in town anymore, and it might get a bit harder for Netflix to hook and retain new subscribers. In Netflix's July 16 earnings report, weaker-than-expected growth in new subscribers sunk the stock as much as 20% in the weeks following, though it recovered slightly about 22 points this week and now trades at $339. Before its latest earnings report, it was trading at about $400.

Nowadays, fans of high-quality TV have a wealth of choice in where to fork over a few bucks on a monthly subscription. There's Hulu ($8/month), HBO Now ($15/month), Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube TV ($40/month, which includes live network TV), and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, which is free with a Prime subscription or $9/month without. And more are on the way, with Apple (AAPL) building a media streaming bundle of its own, and Disney (DIS) planning to roll out its 'Disneyflix' competitor in 2019.

Netflix will soon be reaching limits on how large it can grow in the U.S.

For now, Netflix's main selling points are its low subscription fee -- just $8 for a basic membership, with more expensive tiers that allow multiple devices -- and its steady output of great original shows that attract a cult following (""13 Reasons Why"" and ""Stranger Things"" are two of Netflix's current hits, earning shout-outs on a May earnings call.)

""Like anything else, quality is what ultimately matters and sells -- you get what you pay for,"" said Hale Boggs, a Manatt, Phelps & Phillips partner specializing in media and technology. ""It all started with Netflix and 'House of Cards,' and paying what was then considered an extravagant amount for Spacey's contract [lead actor Kevin Spacey reportedly made $5 million in the show's first season]. Now, we're seeing high quality content paid for by companies other than Hollywood studios -- Facebook allocating a billion dollars to original content, Amazon creating Amazon Studios. Now these companies are as prominent, if not more prominent than the entrenched Hollywood studios.""

The upshot? Content is getting more expensive. Netflix was expected to spend $8 billion on original and licensed content in 2018, but may spend as much as $13 billion according to a Goldman Sachs estimate; Amazon is expected to spend $5 billion, and Apple is said to be spending $1 billion this year. (In Netflix's case, it probably doesn't help that the stars of its most popular shows have recently begun asking for substantial raises.)

With competition ramping up, that perfect balance of low prices and quality shows that made Netflix a phenomenon -- and a hero to long-term shareholders, who've seen an incredible 30,000% return in value since Netflix's 2013 IPO -- could be endangered.

In the meantime, Netflix is making some tweaks: This week for example, it started testing promotional ads for its own original content. It's is also distancing itself from a longtime frenemy, Apple's iTunes, by testing a bypass of iTunes payments in 33 countries that would instead direct new subscribers to Netflix's mobile site.

So far, Netflix has only raised prices occasionally and in small increments.

To be sure, Netflix is still dominant in the U.S., with 51% of U.S. streaming households subscribing to Netflix, followed by Amazon Prime Video at 33% and Hulu at 14% according to a May CNBC survey (many households subscribe to more than one service). But as the field grows more crowded, Netflix might consider some even more radical changes -- starting with its pricing.

""What's going to happen is that there will be too many choices for people, the same as with cable. There will be cannibalization, and this is where Netflix may lose out because they haven't stratified their content,"" said Per Sjofors, CEO of pricing research firm Atenga Insights. ""They have differentiation on how many screens you want, but the content is still seen as one homogenous lump of stuff.""

Read More of 'The Tech Skeptic'

Sjofors suggested that Netflix could jack up its lowest pricing tier of $7.99 per month for single-screen viewing by $2 without losing any U.S. subscribers. But as competition grows, more choices in pricing could win the day -- not by number of screens, as Netflix does currently, but by interest, content type or some other means of categorization.

""If you look at the competition, Amazon Video has add-ons [through Amazon Channels] that you can buy for $5 per month and up, and what that means is they make more money, and they have more satisfied customers,"" Sjofors added. ""People are willing to pay more money to get just the right content that's within their interests.""

Sure, 'Amazon Prime Video and chill' doesn't have quite the same ring to it. But as a certain Netflix drama suggests, stranger things have happened.

Alright, let's recap quickly, so you can enjoy your weekend.

Here's what you need to know from TheStreet today.

PayPal's Got a Monster Up its Sleeve

Say what?

TheStreet's Brian Sozzi says Venmo might be a billion dollar business for PayPal (PYPL) . And, as usual, he's got the sources to back up the claim.

A new survey of 1,500 internet users by RW Baird's tech analyst Colin Sebastian shows Venmo is one of the most dominant payment platforms.

""Among the 40% of respondents using digital wallets, Venmo adoption was on par with Apple Pay, although this likely includes affirmative responses for P2P transactions. Nonetheless, we view this strong showing as a positive leading indicator of longerterm Venmo monetization,"" Sebastian says.

Sebastian sees the momentum behind Venmo helping to bring in the big bucks for PayPal over time.

Whew.

Funny that, I did just get a Venmo request from a friend. Maybe Sozzi and Sebastian aren't that far off.

How's Retail Looking?

TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer penned a piece for TheStreet's sister site, RealMoney. He's not sounding overly bullish on the retail sector.

I mean, what can you expect when the headline is, What Happens When Retail's Share Donors Whither Away?

""J.C. Penney, a once all great and powerful retailer, only has $12 billion left. Notably there are 574 Sephoras in Penney's. Now any sort of closings are most likely good for Bluemercury of Macy's (M) and Ulta (ULTA) . But it is still too early to make a difference,"" Cramer wrote.

'Jay' Powell Sounds Doveish

TheStreet's Bradley Keoun kept a hawk-eye on the Fed chair's speech from Jackson Hole, Wyo. on Friday, Aug. 24, but Jay Powell, who's previously sounded pretty hawkish, sounded more doveish this time.

The Federal Reserve's monetary-policy officials believe a ""gradual process"" of rate increases ""remains appropriate"" as the U.S. economy heats up and the labor market tightens, Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday.

""Most people who want jobs can find them,"" Powell said Friday in prepared remarks for a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""With solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation, rising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arriving, there is good reason to expect that this strong performance will continue.""

Powell's speech comes just days after the release of minutes from the Fed's monetary-policy meeting earlier this month, where officials voted to keep rates steady while planning further ""gradual"" hikes to prevent a surge in inflation.

The Federal Open Market Committee, which Powell heads, voted at the meeting in Washington on July 31 and Aug. 1 to hold borrowing costs steady in a range of 1.75% to 2%. The central bank has been raising rates since late 2015, after holding rates near zero for years in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Two more interest rate increases are expected by the end of the year.

https://www.thestreet.com/story/13204282/1/top-10-rich-kids-of-instagram--who-to-follow.html,"When Instagram launched in 2010, it was designed for people to share and show off photos of their lives to friends and followers, and the young and wealthy elite have taken advantage of it. The Rich Kids of Instagram Tumblr began several years ago and has spent that time curating content that shows off the lives of the young, rich and Insta-famous, or Insta-infamous. Of course, ""kids"" isn't the perfect phrase for it. Some of these people are in their 30s - but as heirs, heiresses and the children of industry titans, they remain rich kids. Currently it boosts thousands of followers across all social media, with its Instagram account racking up more than 387,000 followers. Hashtags like #RKOI and #richkidsofinstagram became popular to use in both ironic and unironic fashions, some to mock the overindulgent nature of the photos and others to merely keep indulging in it. Whatever your choice, its popularity on social media was absolutely undeniable. ""It's fun, brash, sexy, intriguing and a window into another world for people,"" a spokesperson for Rich Kids of Instagram said in an email. ""I think there's a love/hate relationship with it, and that keeps it relevant and popular."" Parading the lives of young elite has become so popular that the E! Network, owned by NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast (CMCSA) , launched a show called #RichKids of Beverly Hills in January 2014. The show averages between 590,000 and 1 million viewers per episode in key demos, ages 18-49, according to a company spokesperson. The show ended after 4 seasons in 2016. The reasons for following the rich kids of Instagram are surprisingly varied. Many follow for aspirational purposes, wanting the luxurious lifestyle for themselves. Others see them as a good hate-follow, unable to look away from the absurd amount of wealth spent on jets, yachts and huge parties. And others still are just hoping for a follow-back to boost their brand. That's how you get the amazing number of followers that so many #richkidsofinstagram have accrued. While it's certainly not a comprehensive one, here's a list of ten rich kids you should follow: Dan Bilzerian - 23.8 million followers At 37 years old, Dan Bilzerian is not a kid. But his playboy lifestyle (and the fact that his father is a famous corporate takeover specialist) qualifies him for this list. From showing off his stacks of cash to posing with hoards of scantily clad females, Bilzerian is continually sharing photos of how he is living the high life to more than 10 million followers. Bilzerian is so popular he ranks 34 out of 100 on analytics tracker Social Blade's list of Top 100 Instagram Users by Followers, positioned just above international reggaeton star J Balvin. Even his cat is popular. Smushball has more than 716,000 followers, for the many people who cannot resist seeing adorable animals in more expensive clothing than their own. Bilzerian might have been kicked off of Snapchat six hours after he started his account, but that doesn't keep college-aged males from keeping tabs on one of their favorite bad boys. His estimated net worth is approximately $150 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. And don't be fooled by the photo above: he may not ""do country clubs"" but there is no shortage of pictures on Dan Bilzerian's Instagram of him attending swanky parties, hanging out at island resorts and jet skiing. Like in the photo above, though, he is shirtless in all of them.

Dorothy Wang - 1 million followers The first of Rich Kids of Beverly Hills to appear on this list, Dorothy Wang has gained a huge following even before she became a reality star. The 27-year-old's father is Roger Wang, the CEO of Golden Eagle International Group, which owns China's largest mall chains. Her father's net worth is almost $4 billion according to Forbes. After #RichKids premiered, Wang was catapulted to Instagram success, gaining over 50,000 followers that first night. To date, she has surpassed 7 figures and reached one million followers. She was one of several cast members to stay on the show for the entire duration. She now has her own line of jewelry called #FABULUXE in addition to her reality TV success. Per Celebrity Net Worth, she herself is now worth approximately $10 million. Combine that with family billions, and you've got a social media feed filled with exotic vacations and fancy weddings.

E.J. Johnson - 664,000 followers With more than 664,000 followers, Earvin ""E.J."" Johnson III doesn't have more followers than his famous father Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, the basketball legend and part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers who has 1.4 million followers on the social networking site. Like many on this list, the 26-year-old is also featured on E!'s popular #RichKids series, and was promoted to series regular at the start of season two. By the end, he had received his own spin-off series, EJNYC, that lasted one season. With his own net worth estimated at $2 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Johnson has worked to set himself apart from his famous father. The former New York University student not only stars on Rich Kids but also works with the network on Fashion Police, E! News and is a correspondent for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.

Roxy Sowlaty - 449,000 followers Yet another #RichKid, Roxy Sowlaty, 30, joins her former cast members on this list after amassing more than 449,000 Instagram followers. She is the daughter of Sam Sowlaty, who runs Acuprint, a printing company based in Los Angeles. The self-proclaimed Persian princess attracted viewers' sympathy during her show's first season, when her parents cut off her bank accounts after she repeatedly over spent. Sowlaty is currently running her own interior design firm in Los Angeles and sells home goods on her website, such as a discounted $28 princess candle and a $525 chair. Her individual net worth is estimated at $600,000, according to Celebrity Net Worth, or nearly 1,143 of those chairs.

Chryseis Tan - 335,000 followers 29 years of age, Chryseis Tan is the daughter of Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, who founded Berjaya Corporation Berhad. Chryseis boasts over 335,000 followers on her Instagram account, and her feed is filled with palm trees, oceans, plane rides and one expensive-looking wedding. Forbes estimates that her father is worth $820 million, and she is one of eleven of his children. Chryseis, though, has a job closely-related to her dad; she is the CEO of Berjaya Times Square. Earlier this year, she was wed to Faliq Nasimuddin, a fellow heir. Faliq's father also founded a Malaysian conglomerate, Naza Group.

Evan Luthra - 307,000 followers He is a 23-year-old entrepreneur who has millions of dollars and thousands of followers - Evan Luthra seems to have it all. Born in India, the mini-mogul began his career curating technology news at age 12, before moving on to developing mobile apps at the age of 13, according to his website. He now runs EL Group International, which combines designs and development to create custom applications. Luthra's company boosts Google, Unilever and Godiva Chocolatier as some of its clients. It is not just helicopter rides, giant bottles of champagne and beautiful women for Luthra. He is also an accredited angel investor and is reported to have contributed $250,000 to nine separate startups. Luthra's net worth is unknown.

Robert Cavalli - 244,000 followers Yet another list member who benefits from having a famous parent, Robert, or Robin, Cavalli, is the youngest son of fashion legend Roberto Cavalli and Eva Duringer. Cavalli's Instagram is a mix of selfies and gourmet food photos with a few pictures in between of his high society European friends. To get an idea of his extravagant lifestyle, in one photo Cavalli holds a 100-carat diamond ring in front of a Roy Lichtenstein original. Robin, 24, lived in London and attended Regent's University London, according to a blog post by his father. Per his profile description, he is currently based in Milan. Robert one day will be able to inherit, along with his four siblings, his father's estimated-to-be $500 million fortune, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Barron Hilton - 224,000 followers The younger brother of socialites Nicky and Paris Hilton, Barron Hilton, 28, has a considerable following on Instagram, an incredibly on-the-nose family name and surprisingly was not featured on Rich Kids of Beverly Hills. With more than 224,000 followers, Barron still lags behind sister Paris, who has more than 9.5 million followers. Unlike his famous sisters, Barron has stayed out of the public's eye for the most part, and his Instagram lately has been vacation photos with his wife Tessa. Hilton graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 2015. The hotel-heir made headlines in 2011, when he was fined $4.6 million in damages for seriously injuring a gas station worker with his car while driving under the influence. He also grabbed headlines in 2013 after being attacked in a bar fight, which he claims was at the behest of troubled star Lindsay Lohan. Hilton's net worth is estimated to be $15 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Peter Brant - 132,000 followers The son of magazine publisher and art collector Peter M. Brant, Junior, 24, is a model and heir who was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. His status as a socialite was established early on; at just 18, he and his brother Harry, 15, got a write-up in the New York Times. Today he has over 132,000 Instagram followers who view his expensive clothes, vacations and events. Brant was a student at Bard College, and is worth $2 million from various endeavors, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In 2016, he was arrested for throwing a drunken temper tantrum at JFK airport, the kind of thing even being rich can't get you out of.",2018-08-24,

Aug. 22 marks the longest bull market on record (according to most observers) since World War II at 3,500 days. Since the S&P 500 touched a bear market low of about 676 on March 9, 2009, it has skyrocketed 323% on the back of strengthening profit growth by Corporate America.

Suffice it to say, the stock market is nearing its bull market record on Wednesday with a good deal of momentum. But Blackstone vice chairman and veteran investing mind Byron Wien, 86, tells TheStreet the bull is far from ending its hard charge.

""The bull market is not over, we are only in the fifth inning,"" Wien says. Wien sees the S&P 500 reaching 3,000 by year end, up from 2,865 currently. Powering the market's next leg higher, Wien says, is likely to be strong corporate profits under the business friendly Trump administration. More stocks beyond FANG (Facebook (FB) , Apple (AAPL) , Netflix (NFLX) , and Alphabet (GOOGL) ) should help drive up the market to new records, Wien says, pointing to healthcare and industrials being undervalued sectors.

Others on Wall Street share Wien's longer term sector calls.

Producers and consumers have been retrained to buy goods domestically, as President Trump has enacted tariffs and initiated what some fear could become a full-blown trade war with foreign trade partners. So pricing power may emerge as a tailwind for domestic raw material and industrial companies.

""Looking at the factors at play today, between ongoing tariff tensions and a greater ""America-first"" focus, producers and consumers are looking domestically for goods and services,"" said Mike Loewengart, VP of Investment Strategy at E*TRADE. ""So with U.S. raw materials, like lumber and tools, growing in demand, it will help drive this sector up.""

Wien doesn't see a recession until 2021. While Wien acknowledges the Fed could be a risk to markets, he thinks they will err on the side of being more accommodating on rates.

Rock on, bull market.

Summer Fridays offer a slowdown in market volume and a good opportunity to catch up on broad market developments.

It's impossible not to be aware of the performance of the Nasdaq as FAANG-mania dominates the financial press, but there are other markets. Please do not make the mistake of thinking they are not all interlinked. That line of thought got us into trouble at this time of year 10 years ago. The underexplored corners of the market may offer outsize returns, and my new Real Money Best Idea, Navios Maritime Acquisition (NNA) , is one such name. Please read my piece from Thursday on the shipper of dry bulk commodities if you have not done so already.

While I can't find any markets that have been hit as hard thus far in 2018 as the market for very large crude carriers, there are some notable losers outside the FAANG thunderdome. Courtesy of The Wall Street Journal's excellent Markets Data Center, here are a few asset classes in the red thus far in 2018 and my thoughts on whether their lagging performance indicators represent buying opportunity.

First up are the Argentine peso (down 38.9% versus the U.S. dollar in 2018 through Aug. 23) and Turkish lira (down 37.9% versus the dollar over the same period). Currencies of emerging markets have been sold off this year, and these two stand out in particular. The only way to play this is to game political macroeconomics, which is difficult.

That said, Greece's emergence this week from eight years of European Central Bank (ECB) support shows that, whatever your political view, bailouts do work. So, if you can predict the next one you will make tremendous profits. This requires hours of research and thus far I haven't done that for my clients' accounts, but I plan to in the near future. The Brazilian real (down 19.5% year to date), Russian ruble (down 15.9%) and South African rand (down 14.1%) are three other currencies that are badly in need of central bank support.

Emerging markets bonds (down 7.7% YTD) also have performed poorly this year, and the calculus is similar to the currency plays. It's all about government intervention, because without intervention the era of ""king dollar"" - - as formerly espoused almost every day on CNBC by Larry Kudlow, now senior economic adviser to the president -- will continue unabated.

The Shanghai Composite (down 17.5%), South Korea Kospi (down 7.5%,) and Japanese Nikkei (down 1.6%) have been major laggards in 2018. Anyone who has traveled Asia, as I just did again this summer, knows that China is not an emerging market, but its stocks have taken on the guise of a submerging market. I think it's overblown, but I am waiting for a full-on panic to ensue as can be expected in market with elevated leverage and imperfect information.

From a broader point of view, there is not anything that Facebook Inc. (FB) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are doing here in the U.S that is not being done by Asian players. Corporate titans in Japan and South Korea are underappreciated, while Chinese Internet stocks get the bulk of the attention. I see value in names such as Samsung, Toyota, LINE and LG, and I'll have more on that in future columns.

Then there are 7-10 year U.S. Treasurys (down 2.6%) and +20-year U.S. Treasurys (3.8%). These assets should be performing more poorly at a time when the U.S. economy is absolutely exploding. Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT) results were certainly confirmation of that. Long rates need to start increasing because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) must keep lifting the fed funds rate to calm inflation in the face of a red-hot consumer, which makes a flat yield curve contradictory.

I make it a point never to argue with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, but his call of a move to 4% on the 10-year Treasury in the next year is showing zero signs of materializing. If the yield curve inverts, that's it. That will be the end of the longest bull market run in U.S. history.

As of Wednesday the New York Fed held $2.171 trillion (yes, trillion with a t) of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. That overhang has suppressed long rates for the past eight years, but pressure from the short end of the curve is finally showing how much of an artificial market stimulant the Fed's bond holdings provide to the market. Don't ignore that.",,
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/paypal-potential-billion-dollar-business-that-kids-love-using-venmo-14692902,"The 20-something year old driven surge in popularity for PayPal's (PYPL) could just be getting started.

The Call

Sorry, Apple (AAPL) Pay. A new survey from RW Baird tech analyst Colin Sebastian of 1,500 internet users has Venmo being among the most dominant payment platforms.

""Among the 40% of respondents using digital wallets, Venmo adoption was on par with Apple Pay, although this likely includes affirmative responses for P2P transactions. Nonetheless, we view this strong showing as a positive leading indicator of longerterm Venmo monetization,"" Sebastian says.

Sebastian sees the momentum behind Venmo helping to bring in the big bucks for PayPal over time.

Sebastian says, ""Given the myriad of of monetizable avenues for Venmo, the range of medium-term outcomes are quite wide. Our analysis suggests a base case incremental revenue contribution in 2021 of $300 million, a reasonable upside scenario of $475 million, and a ""best case"" scenario of more than $1 billion -- with margins above those of core PayPal.""

2Q By The Numbers

PayPal doesn't specifically break out Venmo's performance, but often gives solid clues. One can infer that the business remained healthy in the second quarter.

Via PayPal's management on the second quarter earnings call:

P2P volume which is a component of merchant services and includes volumes across core PayPal Venmo and Xoom grew 50% to $33 billion and represented approximately 24% of total payment volume versus 21% in Q2 2017.

On the consumer side active account growth was predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo. We also added more than 600000 merchants to our platform ending the quarter with more than 19.5 million merchants.

We just had our biggest quarter over ever of new users on Venmo and great growth of $14 billion and volume up 78% year-on-year. And we're basically spending next to nothing on marketing because our users to our marketing for us.

TheStreet Says

Wall Street has sent PayPal's stock down 4% over the past month on fears of slowing growth. While it's easy to understand that logic, PayPal's efforts to monetize Venmo, aggressively use its cash to buy other businesses and expand old school PayPal into new payment mediums (Facebook (FB) Messenger, for instance) should not be overlooked.

Says PayPal Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready to TheStreet's @AnnieGaus:

""Seventeen percent of Venmo users have engaged in a monetized experience so far this year, and you're seeing really noteworthy merchants like Uber, Uber Eats, GrubHub (GRUB) , Seamless, Eat24, Williams Sonoma (WSM) , all adding dedicated Venmo buttons to their sites and apps. So we're very early innings and think there's a lot left to go but the really great [thing] to see is that there's fantastic customer demand for it, on both the customer and merchant side. So we think there's still tremendous growth left to go in those.""",2018-08-24,Apple

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/china-launches-robot-workforce-as-a-response-to-rising-wages-14691312,"The world's most populous country is not running from the robot revolution. It is embracing automation, and all that goes with it.

Last week, 533,000 visitors packed the World Robot Conference in Beijing. The western media focused on bionic flying foxes and tiny soccer-playing robots. The bigger story is China's growing prowess in smart machines.

Indeed China is preparing for the next industrial revolution.

We should have seen this coming. In 2014, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, welcomed a robot revolution in manufacturing. In only two decades, cheap labor pushed the country from relative poverty to the second largest economy in the world.

In the process, wage growth exploded higher. In Shanghai, a hotbed of manufacturing, monthly incomes have increased 250% in the last decade alone. Economists see no end in sight as birthrates slow and the working Chinese get a taste of western-style consumption.

Xi's plan is to boost productivity through aggressive automation. In theory, the manufacturing world will gravitate to China for its robotics expertise, and stay to serve its growing consumer economy.

In 2016, the International Federation of Robotics reported Chinese automation sales volume reached the highest level ever recorded for a single country. For perspective, at 87,000 units, Chinese buying was around the same as Europe and the United States combined.

Growth was driven by the electronics industry. In 2016, Foxconn, a leading contractor, began outfitting its factories with artificially intelligent robots. By May of that year, the South China Morning Post reported the Apple (AAPL) iPhone builder eliminated 60,000 jobs in a single factory on the outskirts of Shanghai.

In 2018, another suburban Shanghai facility pushed the limits of automation even further. JD.com (JD) , a major e-commerce company, unveiled a warehouse capable of fulfilling 200,000 orders per day. Products are picked, packaged and routed for shipping all day, every day, under the watchful eye of only four humans. And their role is merely robot servicing.

Scenes from the World Robot Conference in Beijing.

As productivity increases, JD.com is building out warehouse distribution at a frenetic pace. In 2018, warehouse space grew 85% , to 10.9 million square meters. It is even experimenting with drones so proficient they can carry 60 pound payloads, while speeding across the Chinese countryside at 60 mph.

With a workforce of 998 million, the politics of automation might get in the way of strategic long-term economic planning. In China, not so much. In March, President Xi became a leader for life as term limits were removed.

And despite the ongoing trade war with the Trump administration, he is pushing forward with Made in China 2025 . The plan is to move the country up the value chain with state investments in aerospace, clean energy cars, advanced basic materials and especially robotics. In doing so, China would move from an economy of low value, low wage industries toward high tech.

Investors need to understand the context. They also need to see the opportunity.

The Play

Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) makes flexible, scalable systems used to design tiny integrated circuits, the building blocks for the next generation of intelligent electronic products.

Semiconductor design is becoming more complex than ever. Cadence makes the tools to design the intellectual property central to Made in China 2025.

In July 2018, Cadence announced it was selected by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon research group, to help build a new unified platform to automate the design of next generation processors and printed circuitboards.

Its current business is growing steadily, with strong cash flow. In 2017, operating cash flow surged to $471 million, on $1.9 billion in sales.

According to a slide deck posted this month for use at the Oppenheimer technology conference, Cadence services all of the top semiconductor enterprises. It has 4,100 research and development engineers and 1,500 professionals in the field, including innovation centers scattered throughout South Eastern Asia.

Diminutive, consumer-friendly robots are cute. However, a battle to control the future of smart machines is heating up. Cadence is in the right places, at the right time. Consider buying on pullbacks in the shares.

1. -- Stocks Flat as U.S. and China Announce New Tariffs

U.S. stock futures were flat to slightly higher on Thursday, Aug. 23, as the U.S. and China applied tit-for-tat tariffs amid a continuation of trade talks.

Stocks ended mixed on Wednesday, Aug. 22, after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting on July 31-Aug. 1 indicated central bank officials saw signs that wages were poised to accelerate, lending credence to the Fed's push to raise rates to head off a surge in inflation.

Despite the mixed finish on Wednesday, stocks set a record for the longest bull market run in history, turning 3,453 days old. It eclipsed the previous record set in the 1990s, which ended with the dot-com bust.

The U.S. and China imposed fresh tariffs on $16 billion of each other's goods. The 25% duties included automobiles and metal scrap from the United States and Chinese-made factory machinery and electronic components.

China said Thursday it would lodge a complaint on the new U.S. tariffs to the World Trade Organization.

Saudi Arabia's energy minister on Thursday denied reports that the kingdom had abandoned plans for a public listing of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco.

""The government remains committed to the IPO of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,"" said Khalid Al Falih, minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources and chairman of Saudi Aramco. ""This timing will depend on multiple factors, including favorable market conditions.""

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/uber-hires-new-cfo-14690671,"As Uber Technologies Inc. contemplates a public offering, the ride-sharing company said Tuesday that it has hired Nelson Chai as Chief Financial Officer.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi did not look to Silicon Valley to fill the role that had been vacant for three years, but to the sleepy world of insurance and warranty. Chai was most recently CEO of TPG Capital-backed The Warranty Group before the Chicago company's $2.5-billion sale to Assurant, Inc. (AIZ) , which closed in May.

The ride-sharing outfit is ""trying to look respectable for Wall Street for the IPO,"" 451 Research analyst Christian Renaud suggested.

""They have had too much of a reputational deficit from the founders as being rather cavalier, which equals risk to the street ... which would damage the IPO odds."" Renaud said.

Khosrowshahi arrived from Expedia (EXPE) in August 2017 after founder Travis Kalanick resigned amid controversy about a sexist culture and other workplace issues. The ride-sharing company raised capital from Altimeter Capital Management, Coatue Management LLC and TPG that reportedly valued the company at $62 billion. That's well above the $48 billion valuation from Softbank Corp.'s December 2017 investment, but below its prior high valuation of $68 billion.

Chai continues Uber's C-Suite makeover. Before running Warranty Group, he was a president at CIT Group Inc. (CIT) ; chief financial officer at Merrill Lynch & Co.; and CFO of NYSE Euronext after the company merged with electronic stock exchange Archipelago Holdings. He also sits on the board of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO)

Uber's last CFO, Brent Callinicos, stepped down in March 2015 but remained a strategic adviser to the company through September 2016, according to his LinkedIn page.

The head of Uber's global finance team, Prabir Adarkar, left to become CFO of meal-delivery service DoorDash Inc. in July.

Chai fills an important spot at Uber, but Khosrowshahi may still have more hiring to do before he takes the company public. In June, marketing group Endeavor LLC poached Uber's chief brand officer Bozoma Saint John. Saint John had been a high-profile addition from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Khosrowshahi may want to add a chief marketing officer to continue rebuilding the brand before hitting the public markets.

First thought as the Cohen and Manafort decisions hit the wires Tuesday afternoon: Wednesday will be the first day in the end of the record-setting bull market run. Hard not think like that seeing as the market tanked into the close and now the president is increasingly in hot water.

But something interesting happened in the moments since the decisions hit the wires: stocks globally didn't fall apart and U.S. futures have started to come back. Perhaps, it's not good to read too much into the tape in a span of 12 hours, but it's telling. It's telling as to where the minds of investors are right now: squarely on the corporate profit outlook and not DC drama.

Like it or not, that's where the market is until D.C. drama suggests President Trump is nearing a Nixon moment or the blow-back from Cohen/Manaofrt will lead to a Democratic onslaught in November. Check out TheStreet's 'Trader Chat' that we held Tuesday evening discussing the market impact from the Cohen/Manafort decisions.

The Data Dump

More meat for the bulls to chew on to feel emotionally satisfied. The Dow Transports are hovering around a record after tacking on 6 percent over the past month. ""This is quite positive because the airlines HAD been lagging BADLY from March until June -- in fact, the XAL fell into correction territory at its late June lows,"" points out Miller Tabak strategist Matt Maley on the move in the Transports. ""However, it has rallied nicely since then (almost 10%) and looks like its ready to break-out even more."" For watchers of the Dow Theory, the action in the transports is a bullish indicator for the broader market.

Dow Theory states that major trends in the market must be confirmed by the transport and industrial averages. These are the sectors at the ground level of global economic demand, after all.

More specifically, here are several more sectors TheStreet's sources said could be positioned particularly well for the next leg of the bull market.

Raw Materials

Producers and consumers have been restrained to buying goods domestically, as President Trump has enacted tariffs and initiated what some fear could become a full-blown trade war with foreign trade partners. So pricing power may emerge as a tailwind for domestic raw material and industrial companies.

""Looking at the factors at play today, between ongoing tariff tensions and a greater ""America-first"" focus, producers and consumers are looking domestically for goods and services,"" Loewengart said. ""So with U.S. raw materials, like lumber and tools, growing in demand, it will help drive this sector up.""

Consumer Discretionary

Should wage growth and strong employment data be a part of stronger, and broader economic and market growth story ahead, consumer discretionary players could be set for gains. ""Consumer discretionary should do well if we see wage growth and increased spending,"" Loewengart said. ""Valuations for the sector are reasonable, but in line to above the market.""

Indeed, Starbucks (SBUX) only has a trailing-twelve month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.4 times. McDonalds (MCD) has a trailing PE ratio of 20.92 times. The S&P 500 has a PE ratio of 24.75 times.

Chris Wolfe, Chief Investment Officer of First Republic Wealth management told TheStreet recently ""be in consumer discretionary"" because ""the wage story is pretty good.""

FAANG's

""Despite the issues [sharp selloffs] seen in the FAANGs earlier this month, they continue to show resilience and claw back from their recent tumble,"" Loewangart said. That group of stocks is perhaps one of the most interesting ones to consider longer term. All the companies in the group are large, profitable {although Netflix is free cash flow negative}, and doing things to reinvent how life is handled.

Morgan Stanley backed up Loewengart's bullish view.

Average portfolio allocation to large-cap tech stocks amongst institutional investors rose 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the second-quarter this year, according to a note from Morgan Stanley analysts. Investors added heavily to Apple (AAPL) , Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) , and Alphabet (GOOGL) .

Investors see huge promise in Apple's services business, which is currently in its infancy and high growth mode, growing 31% year-over-year in the fiscal first-quarter. Meanwhile, iPhone X sales performed well, amidst doubt on demand. And still, ""We continue to see the opportunity for a rotation in the institutional investor base as services becomes a more meaningful revenue and profit generator for the company,"" the Morgan Stanley note said.

It probably doesn't hurt that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) billionaire CEO Warren Buffett continues to buy more Apple stock. Buffett is the ultimate long term investor.

Facebook is also still a definite buy, says Morgan Stanley, even though there is the ""potential ad efficiency headwinds around data privacy."" ""We still believe Facebook has among the leading reach and ROIs of any advertising platform,"" the note said. Also, investors can look for ""traction in Facebook's emerging formats/platforms such as Facebook Watch, Instagram TV, Messenger, and WhatsApp.""

Well, for investors, the Kardashian effect is a hell of a selling point, sources tell The Deal's Alexandra Garfinkle. Witness, Kim Kardashian-endorsed haircare line Ouai Haircare, which is among the next likely targets in the beauty space, Garfinkle says. But it's about more than celebrity. Also among the wave of potential beauty targets is eco-conscious sunscreen innovator Coola Suncare. Those two, plus fellow middle market company Paris Presents, are attractive to private equity, though some strategics have dipped into lower revenue auctions to gain access to new and younger audiences. The action piggybacks off an eventful July in the beauty space. Procter & Gamble (PG) acquired prestige cosmetics brand First Aid Beauty in mid-July and consumer-focused PE firm Alliance Consumer Growth closed its oversubscribed fourth fund at $350 million on July 18. Topspin Partners-backed JD Beauty Group acquired Ouidad Holdings on Aug. 13, while beauty conglomerate L'Oreal inked two deals on Aug. 1, the separate acquisitions of German natural beauty brand Logocos Naturkosmetik and French skincare phenomenon Société des Thermes de La Roche-Posay.

We talked about the dearth of public companies a few weeks ago, but at least one company is giving investors hope that a new, exciting listing is coming. Uber Technologies seemingly took a step closer to an IPO on Tuesday with the appointment of Nelson Chai as Chief Financial Officer. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi did not look to Silicon Valley to fill the role that had been vacant for three years, but to the sleepy world of insurance and warranty. Chai was most recently CEO of TPG Capital-backed The Warranty Group before the Chicago company's $2.5 billion sale to Assurant (AIZ) , which closed in May, notes The Deal's Chris Nolter. The ride-sharing outfit is ""trying to look respectable for Wall Street for the IPO,"" 451 Research analyst Christian Renaud suggested. Chai continues Uber's C-Suite makeover. Before running Warranty Group, he was a president at CIT Group (CIT) ; chief financial officer at Merrill Lynch; CFO of NYSE Euronext, after the company merged with electronic stock exchange Archipelago Holdings. He sits on the board of Thermo Fisher (TMO) . While Chai fills an important spot at Uber, Khosrowshahi may still have more hiring to do before he takes the company public. Marketing group Endeavor poached chief brand officer Bozoma Saint John from Uber in June after the high-profile Saint John had arrived from Apple (AAPL) , so Khosrowshahi may want to add a chief marketing officer to continue rebuilding the brand before hitting the market.

Markets Today: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all finished higher, but backed off their highs of the day in late trading on Tuesday.

https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/tuesday-turnaround-trump-takes-on-the-fed-14689586,"It's almost Wednesday.

President Trump made some shots at the Federal Reserve and his nominee, chairman Jerome Powell, on Monday, Aug. 20. But that isn't stopping the market from hitting highs.

Trump Showdown

TheStreet's Executive Editor @BrianSozzi breaks down the smack down.

Donald Trump's latest verbal attack on the Federal Reserve -- designed no doubt to steal the narrative at Jackson Hole-- has me scouring my long off-the-record lunch two weeks ago at the New York Federal Reserve for insights.

Powell continues to lead the market down the path of data dependency when it comes to rate hikes as those that held the spot before him did. If the economic data warrant more rate hikes, Powell will drive consensus and pull the trigger. If the economy says a pause is needed (likely the case later this year), Powell will drive consensus and chill out. It's almost that simple—so simple that even the occupier of the White House could understand.

Said Fed expert and CEO of Quill Intelligence Danielle DiMartino Booth: ""Part of the frustration stems from a lack of appreciation going in that Jerome Powell was no [Janet] Yellen clone. This is a man who once worked for a dollar salary to educate the Congress on the perils of the U.S. defaulting on its debts. His leadership style thus far shows he is more independent that any of his three predecessors and therefore less at risk of caving to political pressures. It's good news for the country long-term but does not necessarily fit a low-rate agenda in the here and now.""

This Isn't Just a Bull Market

@JimCramer referred to this market as a rotational bull market.

""That's why it has long legs,"" Cramer noted. ""It's not just FANG, it's not just pharma, it's not just housing—there is always something that the money goes into."" FANG is an investing term Cramer created year ago -- it stands for Facebook (FB) , Apple (AAPL) , Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) .

Cramer goes even further into his breakdown of this rotational bull market.

""Still, the one thing we know to be the case? Only a recession would give you a rally of this magnitude. These stocks are predicting a recession, plain and simple. I don't believe it, but that's what they have always stood for,"" Cramer wrote in his column for RealMoney, TheStreet's sister site.

When I Say Cheap, You Say BABA

Apparently Alibaba (BABA) is too cheap.

Or at least, that's what an analyst for MKM Partners said.

""We think Alibaba is years ahead of any competitor in driving digital commerce forward,"" said MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson. He has a $280 price target on the stock, indicating massive upside potential of over 60%. ""Of greater consequence is Alibaba's foray into digitizing offline commerce (new retail), which we think is even further ahead and has potential to multiply Alibaba's addressable market,"" Sanderson added.

As Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus stated, ""We remain comfortable with the lower long-term margin profile as it will allow the company to generate a higher level of absolute profit over the long term and should lead to increased efficiencies across Alibaba's entire ecosystem.""

The bottom line is Alibaba is portraying tremendous growth and momentum. Moreover, the stock seems to have borne the brunt of overblown worries around U.S.-China trade worries, as investors ignored the company's micro-level financials. With double-digit growth in all its segments, the stock does not seem to become a loss-making machine anytime soon.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/21/2018/jim-cramer-heres-what-historic-bull-market-has-overcome,"You don't get to be the longest bull market ever, 3,453 days, without doing a lot of things right. That's why we need to celebrate this milestone and, more importantly, learn from it on still one more day where the bull defied the odds and hit a new record high.

The main thing you have to realize when you analyze a bull market is that it climbs a wall of worry, a wall so high, with so much barbed wire and cut glass at the top, that it's almost too daunting to believe.

So without further ado, lets analyze the top walls this market has overcome and how it was able to do so.

First, it's the skepticism. From the very beginning of this bull market, when the S&P 500 was at 666, it just hit 2,872, there was - and still is - rampant disbelief in stocks. It never ends. I googled a bunch of stories about the length of this bull market and not one was remotely celebratory. Just the opposite. Most explained how the bulls was on its last legs. And isn't that the point? It's been on its last legs from the days it started. There's been rampant suspicion of anything and anyone bullish. As someone who has been bullish, I can tell you that I am more ridiculed than most even though I've been right. Being right means nothing if you are bullish. It's the skepticism, I think that's been integral to the length of the bull. This thing would have ended if investors had ever gotten euphoric. However, I think that the Great Recession, the founder of the bull market, is responsible for a lot of the cynical skepticism that confounds us. If we were to lose that attitude than the bull would be in jeopardy. But all I read and heard today was ""is this setting up for a record fall?"" Music to my ears. Let's go a step further. The people who have railed most against this market are hedge fund managers, including some of the biggest names, who have just been dead wrong and many remain dead wrong. They never admit it, though, and they always get away with it.

Number two, we have heard endlessly that valuations are too high, that stocks are just plain too expensive. By any yardstick, at any given time, you could argue that some of the market got too high. But then that part corrects and we start over. Are stocks expensive? Last year at this time they sure seemed to be. Then, though, we got tax reform and it has created an earnings bonanza that makes it clear that stocks weren't expensive. And they have been bountiful versus the paltry return you get from bonds.

There are, at any given time, some visibly expensive stocks of which Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) are the two most obvious. Let's puzzle over that for a second, though. The skeptics have laid bet after bet against these companies and have always come up snake eyes because they deliver far better growth than anyone thought, and this market has always and will always have a bias toward growth.

3. We have had non-stop political turmoil: vicious, often pointless, gridlock, the rise of the Tea Party, the notion that President Obama would not do anything to help the rich people who own stocks and that neither Hillary Clinton nor President Trump would be good for the stock market. The market overcame all of these and, until President Trump unveiled his tariff plan, the bulls have had free reign. Now even these issues seem to be deal-able given that we took out the S&P high today.

4. Don't fight the Fed. The Fed has been raising rates for three years now, taking them from .25 to 2%. We have been schooled that you should not trust a market when the Fed is hiking. But you would have missed fortunes if you believed in don't fight the tape, I think because rates have been so low to begin with. But even here at 2% it has not meant a lot of pernicious competition to stocks even as we heard endlessly they should be. Atlas Shrugged.

5. One of the darkest moments that this bull market suffered was the S&P downgrade of U.S. debt from AAA to AA-plus because of ridiculous political wrangling over debt limits. Shamelessly wrong yet it sure scared a lot of people out of stocks.

6. Bear markets all over the place. One of the secrets of this market is that there are, within all the bullish mirth constant bear markets mauling sectors. Consider today: housing had been in a vicious bear market until we got a monster good quarter from Toll Brothers (TOL) , the high end homebuilder. Toll never bought into the bear and bought back a huge amount of stock; it had 184 million shares three years ago, now it is 153 million. The stock ignited the whole group and it looks like the bear run has ended. Meanwhile a new bear has begun: the oil stocks. They are down huge. We also have a bear market in a lot of semis. That's to be determined but that has been one hot group. Rolling bear and bull markets define this remarkable run.

7. We have had endless woes from Europe. Greece almost defaulted repeatedly -- it is now solvent. Remember the other sick men of Europe? Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain? They were all on their last legs. Now Turkey' on its last legs. Each time I have tried to tell you that these issues will be solved and each time I have been ridiculed. Tiresome but not tiresome to be right.

8. China worries. We have seen China cause tremendous pain here with its stock collapse. China caused one of two flash crashes, this one in August of 2015. It's incredible that any individual stayed in this market given the either crash. But now a couple of years later we are now in fear of anything China does. Collapse and dominance? Two sides of the same strange coin. Most of the media I watch think that Trump's fight with the Chinese is a loser because President Xi plays the long game. But I think the short game that is the stock market-propped up last night by the government, by the way-may shorten what's meant by ""for life.""

9. We are told endlessly that an inverted yield curve means a recession and pure havoc ahead. I think that the 10-year is caught up in a massive manipulation game and should be higher. But I am not as concerned as others because we have been living with this threat for ages and we still went to all-time highs.

10. Is FAANG. We have watched Facebook (FB) , Amazon, Apple (AAPL) , Netflix and Google now Alphabet (GOOGL) , go to astounding levels. They are the big-cap leaders since the bottom. They are scorned by most. I have heard endless downgrades and coroner's inquests about the death of FAANG. I have also heard that the first A, Amazon, would destroy all of retail, and it didn't. I think a lot of the reason why FAANG survives if not thrives comes from re-invention. Facebook bought Instagram which has been a savior. Down here I would not be a seller even as its last quarter was horrendous. Amazon developed Amazon advertising and Amazon Web Services. Apple developed an amazing subscription revenue stream. Netflix went international in a big way. And Alphabet? Self-driving cars. Tremendous advertising growth. And routinely improved Youtube and Google Search.

Now I know there are many other mines and moats that have been wended through and I don't want to slight them. I think I have nailed the real electric jolts that have hit the fair weather friends and the sunshine patriots that should have just stayed put in an S&P 500 index fund and reinvested the dividends. And, of course, invested in some discretionary fliers from Mad Money. It's been a remarkable run, all the more incredible because there's never been much distance between this market being caught and mauled by the bears. Didn't' happen. Congratulations to the bulls.",,

1. -- Stocks Rise, Dollar Slumps After Trump Criticizes Fed

U.S. stock futures posted modest gains on Tuesday, Aug. 21, but the dollar extended its fall after Donald Trump criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates.

Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 53 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 5.25 points, and Nasdaq futures rose 20 points.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.19% to 95.54 after Trump told Reuters in an interview that he was ""not thrilled"" with the Federal Reserve under Chairman Jerome Powell, Trump's appointee, for raising interest rates and said the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy.

""I'm not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no. I'm not thrilled,"" Trump said, referring to Powell. Trump nominated Powell last year to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair.

The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates twice this year and is expected to do so again when it meets in September after consumer price inflation hit 2.9% in July, the highest level in six years. Investors will be watching this week's Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers and for any response from Powell who will speak on Friday, Aug. 24.

2. -- Kohl's Highlights Tuesday's Earnings Calendar

The economic calendar in the U.S. on Tuesday is light.

Kohl's Corp. (KSS) reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.76 a share, higher than estimates of $1.64, while revenue was $4.57 billion, above forecasts of $4.27 billion.

Kohl's also raised its 2018 outlook for earnings per share but the stock fell 3% in premarket trading.

Earnings reports are also expected Tuesday from TJX Cos. (TJX) , Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) , Medtronic PLC (MDT) and J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) .

3. -- Nvidia Chips Are the Future of Gaming

Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) shares were rising 0.7% in premarket trading a day after CEO Jensen Huang delivered the keynote address at Gamescom 2018, the world's biggest gaming expo, in Cologne, Germany, and provided details about the improvements available in Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 2080 series of graphics cards.

The new cards are promised to deliver real-time ray tracing, which is a highly demanding way to portray light realistically in computer-generated graphics, to video games.

Nvidia is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

""The real reason the shares pushed higher (up 1.2% on Monday) is not because of a Turing or ray-tracing related announcement per se, but rather, because this is the first time we've gotten a clear look at the chips that will replace the current line of Pascal-based GeForce GPUs,"" wrote Cramer and the AAP team. ""Essentially, we now have a clearer look at what the next generation of gaming looks like and can start gauging demand for upgrades with established prices that go as high as $1,199. That is a hefty sum, but a justified price based on the significant advances Nvidia has made.""

4. -- Apple Pay Now Accepted at U.S. Costco Locations

Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Apple Pay is now being accepted at all Costco Warehouse Corp. (COST) locations in the United States.

Costco this week activated contactless payments at all of its 750 locations across the country, according to Mac Rumors, and also was outfitting its gas stations with contactless readers.

Costco had been trialing Apple Pay at a warehouse in Issaquah, Wash., near its corporate headquarters, but only now has acceptance rolled out to all of its stores, Mac Rumors reported.

This was clearly new positioning, as volume was far above the strike's open interest of 5,861 contracts. Investitute co-founder Jon Najarian cited the unusual activity at that time on CNBC's ""Halftime Report.""

These investors may have wanted to profit on AAPL shares trading to a new all-time high, but with limited risk, going into the weekend.

Those calls traded up to $4.16 on Friday, five times their initial purchase price. The stock of AAPL rose 2.7% at the same time, showing how quickly options can far outperform their underlying shares.

Long calls lock in the price where investors can buy a stock, letting them position for a rally at limited cost with the potential for significant leverage. They carry less risk than owning shares because the most that can be lost is the price of the options no matter how far the stock might fall.

Apple was up 2% to close at $217.58 on Friday, August 17. The iPhone maker broke out to a lifetime high of $217.94 earlier in its end-of-the-week session.

Nvidia Rebounds

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia (NVDA) , graced the stage as the keynote speaker for Gamescom 2018.

Nvidia, which saw shares fall on light guidance last week, rebounded after Huang announced the company's newest chips.

TheStreet's @NelsonWang reported that, before Huang's entrance, a video ran showing the history of the most advanced graphics rendering shots in movies and video games over the past 20 years. Once Huang opened, he joked that he has never seen a product announcement about which so much had been leaked in advance.

""The good news is that you will get surprised. We didn't do this intentionally, but everything on the web, every spec is wrong,"" Huang said.

Huang then went into considerable detail about the challenges of creating realistic-looking graphics and the giant leaps Nvidia has made in addressing all of them with constantly-advancing chips, but also chip architectures. Ray tracing, which was developed by a computer scientist in the 1970s who's now employed by Nvidia, is one of the major techniques for rendering light realistically. Last week, Nvidia introduced its new Turing GPU architecture.

Are You Ready For Alibaba? TheStreet Is

After soaring from early 2016 to mid-2017, Alibaba's (BABA) shares have mostly tread water over the past 12 months amid spending and macro worries, reported TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa.

That might set the Chinese e-commerce giant up well to rally following its June quarter (fiscal first-quarter) report, should the report show that Alibaba's top-line momentum remains strong going into the back half of 2018. The consensus among analysts polled by FactSet is for June quarter revenue of RMB81.39 billion (up 65% annually and equal to $11.8 billion) and non-GAAP EPS of RMB8.28 ($1.20).

While Alibaba's revenue growth doesn't depend on its giant Taobao and Tmall marketplaces to the same degree that it once did, Taobao and Tmall still accounted for 55% of its March quarter revenue and the lion's share of its gross profit.

Alibaba's Cloud Computing revenue, which is driven by its AliCloud public cloud platform (#1 in China), saw revenue rise 103% to RMB4.4 billion. For the June quarter, the consensus is for Cloud Computing revenue to rise 95% to RMB4.7 billion.

After falling sharply relative to the Chinese renminbi in 2017, the dollar has done the opposite since April. That's set to have an impact on the dollar-based growth that Alibaba reports. Whereas Alibaba saw 61% RMB-based growth and 76% dollar-based growth in the March quarter, the consensus for the June quarter is for 65% RMB-based growth and 59% dollar-based growth.

https://www.thestreet.com/how-to/make-passive-income-ideas-14682731,"Passive income is somewhat of a Holy Grail for income-minded individuals.



After all, earning money without actively working for it -- once you clear a few hurdles -- is a sweet deal, and a great way to augment your income on a regular basis.

[Jump straight to the passive income ideas.]

What Is Passive Income?

In a word, passive income (sometimes known as ""residual income"") is cash that you earn after making an upfront financial or ""sweat equity"" investment, then you sit back and watch the money roll in. Good examples of passive income include:

An author who receives royalties after writing a book.

An entrepreneur who buys a car cleaning shop for an upfront cost, and collects money on the washing, waxing, cleaning, and detailing services charged to clients.

An investor who lives on the dividends and profits earned by making smart stock market moves.

A real estate investor who fixes up a home and rents it out for a profit every month. The profit the owner receives after his or her initial investment is passive income.

Even a cash back credit card qualifies as passive income. You're earning money -- however small -- on cash reward purchases you make with your credit card, and that's enough to be considered passive income.

Passive Income Vs. Active Income

Passive income is the opposite of active income, which is money earned when you perform a service or when you work full- or part-time and earn a salary, a per-hour paycheck, or earn commissions (like a salesperson) or tips (like a bartender.)



The key differentiator between passive and active income is this - with the former, you can make money literally while you sleep. With the latter, if you're not working, then you're not earning any active income.

How the IRS Views Passive Income

Unsurprisingly, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) takes a keen interest in passive income, especially in its most common form -- on real estate, private business and financial market investments.



According to Uncle Sam, you need to be ""materially involved"" in an enterprise to earn active income. With passive income, it's just the opposite, as the IRS deems you to be earning passive income if you're not materially involved with a profit-making enterprise. By and large, expect income to be taxable if you are engaged in a passive income enterprise. You will need to report earnings to the IRS.



There is a taxable upside to passive income. If you lose money, the IRS does allow you to write off passive income as a tax deduction -- which, in a way, is another example of passive income.

20 Passive Income Ideas

While there are dozens of ways to earn passive income, from building a mobile phone app to owning a vending machine, let's stick to the passive income models at the top of the list of the best money-making opportunities.

Passive Income from Investing

Investing in stocks and bonds: Buy a stock, bond or a fund and watch your money grow - that's the idea behind the most popular form of passive income. From 1973 to 2016, for example, Standard & Poor's 500 stocks returned 11.7% annually - a solid return on the dollar for stock market investors over that time period.

Investing in bonds: Similarly, bonds are an attractive way to engage in passive income. Over a recent 45-year period, bonds funds, as measured by Vanguard Funds, returned 7.1%. Of course, there's no guarantee that investments in stocks or bonds will always work out well, investing in them is by far the surest way to generate money through passive income.

Investing in funds and ETFs: Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds bundle different stocks together, usually in the same category (large-cap stocks or auto industry stocks for example.) You pay a fixed price to buy into a fund, based on its current sales price, and can profit via passive income when the fund net asset value (NAV) moves upward.

Stock dividends: Some stocks, especially stocks from big corporate standouts, pay dividends to shareholders based on the number of shares they own, and the percentage of the stock price on the dividend date. For example, if a company pays out 3% on a stock that's trading at $100 per share, you'll earn $3 for every share of that stock you own. Add it up and that can be good take-home pay as a passive investment.

Investing in coins and collectibles: Buffalo nickels and Spiderman comic books are good examples of coins and collectibles that can rise in value, and thus offer opportunity for passive income investors. You'll need to get up to speed on the value of any coin or collectible under consideration, but once you do so, you're on the way to price appreciation on a commodity you'll be paying a lower price to buy, and will garner a higher price when you sell.

Passive Investing From Online Business

Sell items on eBay: There's money to be earned by selling items you buy at a lower price, and selling them for a higher price on sites like eBay and Amazon.

Create an online course: So, you like macramé or collecting rare coins? There's a market for specialized expertise, especially if you can create an online course and sell it on an online platform like Udemy.

Sell stock photos: There's a big demand for stock photos online (individuals, organizations, and businesses use them when they create content online.) If you're a photographer with a backlog of great photos, sent them to stock photo sites like DepositPhotos, who'll pay a commission for any photos sold.

Create a mobile app: Maybe you have a great idea for a mobile app that brings up the best French recipes or the best golf putting tips at the tip of a finger. Hire an app programmer to put it together and sell it on an app store and trigger some passive income.

Start an affiliate marketing website: This passive income model works for individuals who already own a bog or website. Here, your business goal is to contact companies and offer to tout their products and services, usually for a fee or a commission, based on the number of page views you get. Studies show that more people spend time online and less watching TV or reading the newspaper. Take advantage of that leverage and earn income from the tens of thousands of companies who want to reach an audience - maybe your audience. Either reach out to companies directly or go through a site like ClickBank, which offers affiliate marketing opportunities.

Passive Income From Home

Design your own T-shirts: People love T-shirts, and they like making a statement wearing them. Take full advantage with a tee design-service that caters to a unique demographic, like pet owners, beer drinkers, or home gardeners. You can earn royalties on good tee designs using online sites like Amazon Merch.

Buy a small business: A local small business, like a car wash or a laundromat, is a great way to put money down on a money-making venture. Automate it so you don't have to be on the premises unless you're collecting money. Go into a local business with your eyes wide open - study the books, especially on income and expenses, and examine water and utility bills if your venture will be open 24 hours.

Rent out ad space on your vehicle: An emerging market these days, companies will pay you to advertise their products and services on your car, van or truck. Connect with a local or national company on a specialty web site like Wrapify and get your logo on your vehicle. Then, just drive around and collect cash based on your mileage and visibility.

Earn cash-back rewards: Make money using your credit card via cash-back rewards, which actually pays you to use your plastic when making purchases. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card pays you 50,000 points - worth $500, for spending $4,000 in 90 days using the card. Add an approved user to the card and earn even more points and cash.

Pay down your debts: Think about it. Money you're not paying credit card companies and lenders is money you stash right into your savings account. By not paying interest to lenders and using the money to have others paying interest to you, you're engaging in perhaps the purest form of passive income - and enriching yourself in the process.

More Passive Income Examples

Investing in real estate: Investing in real estate offers more passive income cash potential - but more risk - than investing in stocks or bonds. You'll need substantial amounts of cash to invest in buying a home -- it usually takes 20% down to land a good home mortgage loan. But history shows that home prices usually rise over time, so buying home a for $200,000 and selling it for $250,000 over a five-year time period, for example, is a reasonable expectation when investing in real estate.

Investing in rental properties: Another form of real estate investment, rental investments (i.e. becoming a landlord) could steer you down the passive income path of steady monthly rent checks that you can use to pay off a mortgage loan on the rental property. After the mortgage is paid off, those monthly checks go right into your bank account -- potentially for years to come.

Investing in a business: Another good way to generate passive income is to invest in a business --even a small one -- in return for a percentage of the profits - just like Shark Tank, only smaller. Lending $10,000 to a local business that, for example, is working on a mobile app for Apple phones could lead to a passive income-generated share of the profits when that mobile app starts selling like hot cakes.

Peer-to-Peer Lending: Earn up to 10% in returns by lending individuals, organizations and small companies who don't qualify for traditional financing through peer-to-peer lending platforms like Lending Club. You can lend $100, $1,000, or more to borrowers who meet lending platform financial standards. Like a bank, you'll earn interest on the loan - often at higher returns than banks usually get.",2018-08-20,

The DJIA is leading and breadth is better than 2 to 1 positive but much of the market is dead and doing little. The glaring weak spots are FANG and technology names. Even Apple (AAPL) is in the red today after doing much of the heavy lifting lately. Most of the favored momentum groups like biotechnology and semiconductors are weak while retail and marijuana stocks are showing the best relative strength. Canopy Growth (CGC) and Tilray (TLRY) are two pot names on the screens of traders today.

The DJIA is being led by Nike (NKE) , Pfizer (PFE) , DowDuPont (DWDP) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) . There aren't any real themes to the action other than dislike of technology but there is an appetite for long exposure regardless.

This is one of those days where if you are in the sorts of stocks that usually are leaders then you are probably lagging. There is very narrow action in what I consider to be good small cap setups. It is primarily a function of poor seasonality more than anything else.

Estee Lauder (EL) posted an EPS increase over last year of 20% and revenue growth of 14% which are ahead of expectations, but the company cut guidance for next quarter and the next fiscal year. Despite the guidance cut the stock is trading up nearly 4% which is a function of the market anticipating the weak news. It is likely the market expected the company to miss its numbers and is happy that guidance has not been cut more.

Estee is not a cheap stock. It is trading with a trailing PE of 30 and is expected to grow EPS by 11% each of the next two fiscal years that end in June. Someone is willing to pay a premium there but the tepid guidance calls into question why that is the case.

Technically the stock is back over its 200-day simple moving average and needs to hold that level. If it can regain $142.50 or so, it will be back over the 50-day as well. The chart is not at all compelling right now but there is hope that a bottom has formed around $130.

This combination of a high valuation and a lackluster chart would keep me on the sidelines for now.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/20/2018/setting-big-move-fed-news-jackson-hole,"Setting Up For a Big Move on Fed News at Jackson Hole

Late on Friday news hit that the U.S. and China were working on a framework for a trade deal. That helped to boost the indices to finish the week but it has been choppy and inconsistent action for a while.

Most notably the Nasdaq has lagged due to weakness in technology and FANG stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been an exception and that has prevented more relative weakness in the Nasdaq 100, but it has been a market where leadership has shifted to groups that normally don't lead such as retail and industrials.

The choppiness is likely to continue this week for the following reasons:

Seasonality at the end of August suggests thinner and more inconsistent action. Earnings season is mostly complete and news flow tends to be slower until summer vacations are complete. Seasonality doesn't just mean weakness. It can also produce thinner and more volatile action.

The Fed takes center stage at Jackson Hole. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to deliver a speech at Jackson Hold on Friday morning. It is anticipated that Dr. Powell will provide some hints about the pace of interest rate hikes. Jackson Hole was used by Ben Bernanke to announce some of his most significant policy moves and there was a streak of positive reactions over a five year period.

Jackson Hole is an important event and with slower news flow right now, the technical setup into the news will be very important. As I've often stated, the market loves to love the Fed and tends to look for a positive spin but with the economy doing very well and some minor signs of inflation, the potential for a more hawkish tone is higher than normal.

Trade war headlines will continue. The market keeps rejecting the negative narrative on trade and there seems to be few that are embracing a positive outcome on the issue. However, there are signs that a deal with Mexico may be reached soon and that there is some small progress being made with China. The likelihood is that the market will continue to buy dips created by trade war headlines as they continue to work well and should something positive happen it is likely to cause more upside rather than a 'sell the news' reaction.

Inconsistent momentum and lack of leadership. Trading has bene more challenging than usual lately due to inconsistent action in many individual stocks and a lack of quality leadership. There has been strong rotation into some groups like retail and health care but the standard momentum leaders have been acting poorly. There has not been much chasing of strength and the list of new highs is short although breadth has been good.

This is a recipe for a mixed week but should provide an interesting setup into the Jackson Hole event on Friday morning. The market seldom reacts negatively to Fed news but the potential does exist as hawkishness increases. The trading is tough right now and that should continue but there will be opportunities if we do some digging. This is not a market on the brink of collapse but momentum is not as strong as the indices seem to indicate.

Reality Check

Before you head to the mall this weekend, you should know the stock prices of Sears (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) .

Sears closed Friday's session at a record low of $1.31. You can't even get a pair of lightly used, returned underwear for that price from Sears or Kmart. The 27% crash in Sears over the last five sessions is absolutely deserved, as TheStreet pointed out earlier in the week.

In case you missed it:

Sears chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert wrote a letter to the board (which is weird because Lampert controls the company, in effect he is writing himself) released on Tuesday evening (it's always after-market hours with Sears) offering to buy what's left of the Kenmore home appliances business. In the letter, Lampert offers several clues Sears could be headed into its final holiday season amid a major cash crunch. Take note of the comments in bold as they are red flags on Sears current cash position: ""We are writing to submit a non-binding proposal to acquire Kenmore and SHIP and to update the Special Committee regarding our plans with respect to Parts Direct and certain other transactions, as well as to re-emphasize our firm belief that these transactions should be undertaken together with tender and exchange offers designed to allow Sears to reduce its debt, extend its maturity profile and alleviate its liquidity challenges."" ""As we noted in our May 25, 2018 letter to the Special Committee, speed and certainty here are critical. We believe, therefore, that an expedited process is in the best interest of all parties involved."" Why is ""speed and certainty critical"" in Sears case? Keep in mind for the 13-weeks ended May 5, Sears chewed up $1.2 billion in cash just to support its operations that continue to hemorrhage money. The company ended the first quarter with a mere $466 million in cash ahead of shipments of the all-important back to school, early fall shopping seasons. That's a terrible position to be in for a retailer of Sears' size. It's reasonable to expect the company had another brutal second quarter and suppliers are getting worried about being paid for the holidays. This isn't rocket science stuff, it's standard procedure for retailers that are falling apart -- we have seen the script before. Shares are down 51 percent in three months for a reason.

J.C. Penney is in no less sorry shape. Shares of the 116-year old department store ended the week at $1.79, down 27% in the last five sessions, following a dismal second quarter and nasty full-year guidance reduction. The company's bonds have plunged in value.

Around TheStreet

All eyes now turn to the malls that house both of these near dead retailers. J.C. Penney is counted as an anchor store in 71 out of 125 properties for mall owner General Growth Properties ( GGP ) , for example.

For some retirees though, working around the volatility may prove to be worthwhile.

""While it's unlikely that we would recommend anyone, retired or otherwise, to place all their bets on tech or any sector, there are certainly circumstances where technology for a retiree could still make perfect sense, particularly as part of a well-diversified portfolio,"" said Jane Leung, managing director and CIO of Scenic Advisement.

After all, tech companies are still enjoying strong profits as they reinvent many industries. With stocks in the semiconductor and social media spaces well off their record highs, there could be a good opportunity to jump in to earn long-term gains.

""Technology companies are a major part of the U.S. and global economies and are becoming more important with each passing year. If any investor, retiree or otherwise, has no investment in technology, they will be under diversified,"" said Robert Johnson, principal of the Fed Policy Investment Research Group. ""Four tech companies—Apple (AAPL) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) collectively make up over 10% of the S&P 500 . Additionally, the entire tech sector accounts for over a quarter of the S&P 500. If one wasn't invested in the tech sector, one wouldn't have an investment exposure that reflects the broad economy.""

So should retirees approach the sector today?

""While my answer is yes, retirees must be thoughtful about what that technology investment looks like (e.g. relative size, type of investment (large, small, index, single stock). Understanding risk is the most important part of the equation and solution,"" said Leung. ""The reality is that people are living longer these days and need some element of growth returns that can come from investments in sectors such as technology. The question is, however, how much is too much? The answer is that this depends on the overall risk tolerance of the investor and what other assets (and liabilities) they have.""

Leung added, ""Not all technology companies are created equal. Some of the largest tech companies are actually quite diversified and stable and certainly not as risky as a startup technology company.

Amazon's Echo is fast losing market share to Google as well as global players like Alibaba (BABA) and Xiaomi, both of which released smart speaker products in the past year. According to data from Strategy Analytics, Amazon's global market share of voice-activated home speakers fell to 41% last quarter, down from 76% in Q2 of last year. Meanwhile, Alphabet is making huge strides in sales of Google Home, which grew 420% year-over-year, accounting for 28% of total market share last quarter. (If you're wondering where Apple's (APPL) Homepod is in the mix, it ranks a distant fourth at 6% of market share, according to Strategy Analytics data.)

""Google and Amazon's pursuit of volume over margin is making life very difficult for vendors entering the market with products that offer similar features. However, the more premium end of the market does offer opportunity to vendors who can entice consumers with superior build and audio quality,"" said David Mercer, vice president at Strategy Analytics. ""Early adopters of low-cost smart speakers such as the Echo Dot or Google Home Mini and who are now looking to buy a second device will be a key target demographic for such vendors.""

If reports this week are any indication, Alphabet is hoping to wrest even more market share of the this holiday season. The company plans to introduce a new Google Home device equipped with a video display -- similar to Amazon's Echo Show -- in time for the holiday shopping season, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Alphabet plans to ship 3 million units for the first batch of the new Google Home model. By contrast, Amazon shipped 315,000 units of its Echo Show in 2017, according to the market research firm Canalys.

Google also pulled out all the stops at this year's CES conference, seemingly blanketing the show with marketing for Google Assistant, the voice assistant software that underpins Google Home.

A recent deal with JD.com (JD) signals that Alphabet is aggressive about reaching as many homes as possible through the speaker market. In June, Alphabet announced a $550 million investment in JD.com, and as a part of the deal, Google Home will be offered on JD's ecommerce sites.

The home speaker market is still relatively small compared with smartphones, but research indicates that those who own them love the devices and may own more than one. In May, the research firm Canalys estimated that global smart speaker shipments rose 210% annually.

The JD deal ""is a sign that [Alphabet] is deadly serious about not missing the opportunity,"" added Strategy Analytics' David Watkins.

https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/chip-stocks-continue-to-price-in-a-lot-of-bad-news-maybe-too-much-14686774,"A spate of disappointing -- but not truly terrible -- news is leading many chip stock investors to flee to the sidelines.

In some ways, this heightened level of risk-aversion is the polar opposite of the euphoria that has propelled many Internet and software stocks to the stratosphere. For value-oriented tech investors willing to accept a measure of uncertainty, that spells some opportunities.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) fell on Friday after GPU giant and Action Alerts PLUS holding Nvidia (NVDA) and chip equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) both beat estimates but issued below-consensus quarterly guidance. Nvidia, which continues to see very strong server GPU sales and healthy gaming-related demand, put the blame for its outlook on plunging demand for products meant for cryptocurrency miners. That meshes with crypto-related outlooks from AMD (AMD) and others.

Applied, whose outlook might be doing more to weigh on chip stocks than Nvidia's, noted that in addition to a previously-expected mid-year slowdown in demand from memory makers, it's for now seeing lower demand from chip contract manufacturers (foundries). However, the company is maintaining a forecast for industry wafer fab equipment (WFE) spend to top $100 billion during the 2018/2019 timeframe.

Nvidia shares closed down almost 5% on Friday to $244.82. Applied Materials, meanwhile, ticked down almost 8% to $43.77 per share by Friday close.

Applied's outlook, which follows a July capital spending budget cut from top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) , has led several chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) , Teradyne (TER) and Axcelis (ACLS) , to join Applied in selling off. Some of these firms delivered more upbeat earnings reports in recent weeks, often predicting demand will rebound in calendar Q4.

Nvidia and Applied's outlooks follow a handful of other events that had put chip stock investors on edge. Specifically:

NAND flash memory prices have begun slumping, as major production ramps for high-density 3D NAND chips begin impacting the market's supply/demand balance. DRAM's supply/demand balance still looks a lot better, but pricing has stabilized in recent months following a giant rally that started in late 2016.

Microcontroller (MCU) and analog chip supplier Microchip Technology (MCHP) offered soft calendar Q3 sales guidance. Thought the outlook was partly blamed on efforts to lower customer and distributor inventories for recently-acquired chipmaker Microsemi, Microchip also blamed a handful of other issues -- including, notably, the impact of tariff worries on orders from some Chinese clients.

Qualcomm (QCOM) abandoned its $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) , after Chinese regulatory approval failed to arrive by a July 25th deadline. That has naturally cast a pall over the chip M&A landscape, following several years of industry consolidation.

Collectively, these issues provide some reasons for concern. What they don't do, however, is signal a major cyclical downturn is on the way.

As noted earlier, Applied and other major chip equipment makers still expect demand to rebound following a mid-year slump, although there are differences regarding Q4 expectations. Applied, for its part, says the fact that current foundry equipment demand is being driven by orders for equipment with very long lead times for delivery, and that this paves the way for demand to improve in 2019 as the fulfillment of demand for items with long lead times paves the way for orders featuring shorter lead times.

Notably, Applied CEO Gary Dickerson also reiterated his view that the chip equipment industry has become less cyclical. ""More diverse demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise markets, combined with very disciplined investment, has reduced cyclicality,"" he said. ""We're not seeing the large fluctuations in [WFE] spending that we did in the past.""

On the memory front, things will probably get worse for the NAND market before they get better, and -- though the extent of the damage could be restrained if lower prices help boost solid-state drive (SSD) penetration rates -- slumping prices are bound to weigh on the capital spending of NAND makers. But the highly consolidated DRAM market still looks fairly healthy for now, given limited supply growth and the fact that we're entering the seasonally strongest part of the year.

And for equipment makers, the memory industry's growing capital-intensity (i.e., the amount of capex needed to drive a given amount of bit supply growth) remains a positive going forward. As do planned investments by foundry and logic (processor) clients in next-gen manufacturing processes supporting EUV lithography.

Chinese trade tensions are very much a risk for both demand and M&A. But there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. On Friday afternoon, not long after the White House confirmed that trade talks with China have resumed, Dow Jones reported that U.S. and Chinese negotiators are trying to hammer out a plan to end their countries' trade dispute. It goes without saying that both sides are well-aware of the damage that would come from a protracted dispute between the world's two largest economies.

Meanwhile, valuations for chip developers, chip equipment makers and foundries have all become quite reasonable -- in many cases, the multiples seem to already price in a full-blown cyclical downturn. And while the industry does face pressures in areas such as mobile hardware, NAND and crypto mining, other end-markets, such as data center hardware, cars and IoT devices, look a lot better.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/17/2018/musk-we-trust-can-tesla-survive-without-its-leader,"In Musk We Trust: Can Tesla Survive Without Its Leader?

After a telling New York Times interview revealing Elon Musk's shaky state of mind and erratic decision-making process, and even a few earlier blog reports, it's becoming increasingly clear that any Tesla investor has to consider what the stock will be worth with Elon Musk departing the company.

The same New York Times article reported the search for ""No. 2 executive"" to help Musk has intensified in recent weeks.

The issues are mounting on an hourly basis now, whether in the form of subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission or a recent report that Tesla ignored drug trafficking at its Nevada factory.

Some argue that if Musk leaves Tesla altogether, or at least appoints some sort of manufacturing-oriented COO, that this will be the best of both worlds: a visionary Founder, but with the place being run by a competent manufacturing executive. ""The Tim Cook to Steve Jobs' Apple"" as the argument goes.

The first problem with this theory is that it has been tried in one vital and most relevant aspect.

Two years ago, Tesla hired Peter Hochholdinger from Audi. Mr Hochholdinger has been ""Steve Jobs' Tim Cook"" in Elon Musk's Tesla arsenal. Mr Hochholdinger was a top production executive for Audi's Q5, A4 and A5 production. That's about as good a background as it comes, in order to straighten out Tesla's production execution issues. So this solution has been tried before.

If Tesla were valued on regular car industry metrics, the stock would be selling at a tiny fraction of its current market capitalization and enterprise value. Let's say 300,000 cars per year (3x the 2017 total of just over 100,000) to be very generous. For a company that's losing money, getting a $3,000 per car enterprise value might even more generous.

Then $3,000 multiplied by 300,000 units is $9 billion. Let's round up the fully diluted shares to what they may become after dilution, close to 200 million in the near future -- and you might say we have a $45 stock, right? ($9 billion divided by 200 million) While a far cry from today's $300+ price, it would still be above the $17 IPO in 2010 and where the stock was trading until April 2013.

However, the story doesn't end there. Tesla also has over $10 billion in debt as of June 30.

With $10 billion in debt and a working capital deficit of over $2 billion, a $9 billion enterprise value would mean that the equity would be worth less than zero, not $45 per share.

So why is the stock still trading at an undiluted market cap of over $50 billion and $300+ per share? One name and one thing: Elon Musk and raising money.

Elon Musk's main asset to the company is his ability to raise money. Without a $1 billion a quarter average cash inflow from new debt or equity, Tesla does not keep its lights on. Any significant capital investments on top of that, such as a new factory, and even more new debt or equity would be needed.

I contend that trust in Elon Musk is the critical factor in Tesla's ability to attract new debt and equity. If Musk is removed or otherwise not trusted by the market, Tesla wouldn't be able to raise new money, and at that point the company could be as little as a quarter or two away from insolvency. A quick look at the balance sheet in combination with the cash flow statement would yield this conclusion under the light of basic corporate finance analysis.

Therefore, if Musk either departs the firm in whole or in part, and/or he loses the trust with the capital markets, Tesla's enterprise value (let's say $9 billion as in the example above) would be less than its long-term debt and working capital deficit. That means the equity would be worth zero, not even $9 billion or $45 per share. Are Tesla investors, who now start sniffing a Musk departure, disengagement or loss of trust with the capital markets, prepared to see the stock go from over $300 to zero?

Stay tuned for Act Four. The final Tesla chapter has yet to play out. But when it does, it could be a short one.",,Tesla
https://www.thestreet.com/markets/what-is-vertical-integration-and-what-are-the-benefits--14671684,"You could probably recognize a vertically-integrated company from a mile away -- like Ticketmaster and Live Nation (LYV) or Target (TGT) , for instance. But what actually is vertical integration? And how is it used as a business strategy to create some of the most powerful conglomerates in the world?

What is Vertical Integration?

Put simply, vertical integration is a strategic structure where a company owns the supply chain for its product -- so it is usually composed of one or two companies involved in different stages of production. The supply chain incorporates all the steps from taking a raw material to turning it into a product and selling that product -- in that sense, companies that are vertically integrated own multiple (or all) parts of their supply chain. For example, a company may buy out a producer of cotton as well as a t-shirt manufacturing company, and then might market and sell the products themselves. So, the original company (now a conglomerate of several companies along the same vertical, or the same kind product) is now in control of the four parts of the supply chain: commodities, manufacturing, distribution and retail.

There are plenty of benefits for companies to vertically integrate, including being more in control of their supply chain, being able to offer lower prices, and having increased market control. However, there are two different ways a company can practice vertical integration, depending on what type of company it is: backward integration and forward integration.

Forward Integration

When a company expands forward in its supply chain (for example, a manufacturer bought out a retailer), it would be performing forward integration. This is typically done by companies close to the start of the supply chain, like mining companies controlling factories further ""downstream,"" as it is sometimes called. In this case, a manufacturer could take control of its distribution channels to offer products directly to consumers instead of going through a middleman. So, it's pretty simple -- since the company is expanding forward to getting the products out to the consumers, it is integrating forward. Basic stuff.

Backward Integration

On the contrary, when a company expands backward (or ""upstream"") to take control of parts of production further back in its supply chain (if, for instance, a retail company bought out a manufacturer or producer of its goods), it would be exercising backward integration. When the firm merges with the suppliers of raw materials, many costs are typically cut as the company gets everything it needs within itself, rather than having to use outside sources for parts of the process. In this sense, major retail or distribution companies will buy out producers or manufacturers of their goods to save on transportation costs and to keep their suppliers in check.

Benefits of Vertical Integration

Companies pursue vertical integration for the obvious advantages it offers -- namely having greater control over the supply chain and the ability to offer lower prices while increasing market control. But there are plenty of other benefits to vertical integration (whether forward or backward).

Regardless of what the product actually is, most vertically integrated companies have a leg up on the competition, because they can often offer lower-cost or higher-quality products to consumers.

Independence From Suppliers

One of the principle advantages of vertical integration (whether forward or backward) no longer being dependent on suppliers -- and the costs and unpredictability that may come with them. This helps the company or firm increase efficiency by streamlining the process of obtaining supplies for its product, manufacturing it and selling it. In this manner, companies that vertically integrate often are more time efficient -- with shorter turnaround times.

Additionally, since the companies are now independent of external suppliers, they may be immune to supply disruptions -- such as labor strikes or bad management of a supplier. This can help the process go more smoothly and eliminate the possibility of a supply hiccup.

Cost Control

With vertical integration, the ability for manufacturers or retailers to control prices is a huge asset to conglomerates, who would ordinarily have to set some prices to match up with their supply chain. But when companies vertically integrate, they are able to control costs more closely, and often are able to offer lower prices (which translates to increased consumer demand and therefore an increased bottom line). Additionally, companies further downstream in the supply chain will be able to more closely manage how their products are marketed or presented.

Creates Economies of Scale

One of the biggest benefits of vertical integration is that it helps companies create economies of scale. As defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, an economy of scale is ""a reduction in the cost of producing something (such as a car or a unit of electricity) brought about especially by increased size of production facilities"" -- basically, the larger the company gets, the more cost effective it is to produce its goods. And, by keeping management consolidated, overhead and other costs are often reduced.

Having reduced production costs is obviously a huge incentive for companies to vertically integrate.

Increased Product Knowledge and Marketability

Although perhaps one of the less-obvious advantages to vertical integration, being able to understand the market for a product and create their own version (a knock-off, so to speak) is a huge benefit that typically only large companies can enjoy. When a manufacturer is partnered with a retail company along the supply chain, they are able to produce look-alike products (with similar processes or aspects as competitor's products) to those of competitors and distribute them through their retail channels -- and, due to the usual size and grandeur of vertically integrated companies, competitors are often unable or hesitant to sue for copyright infringement.

Thus, a large vertically-integrated company can more readily meet market demands by eyeing products that are selling well and creating their own versions for less.

Increased Market Control

Another major asset of vertical integration (and arguably one of the most important) is the increased market control a company assumes when vertically integrating. It's fairly obvious that when a company higher in the supply chain (like a retailer) merges with a producer or manufacturer, they are going to have more control over that producer's materials and products. In industries where one or two large producers control much of the goods used to make that product, this can translate into a huge amount of control over competitors. By buying a producer or the like, a company could also inherit things like permits, copyrights, resources, and emerging technologies that give it an advantage on its competitors.

Lower Prices

A key advantage for consumers is certainly the lower prices that come with vertical integration. By reducing costs on overhead, transportation and other operational expenses, companies are often able to offer lower prices that attract customers. Companies that have done this include many grocery store brands, Walmart (WMT) , and even Best Buy (BBY) .

Negatives of Vertical Integration

Still, despite the many benefits of vertical integration, it is not always advisable to take that route, as there are several potential negative aspects to consider. While most things in business are trade-offs, it is important to take note of the disadvantages to the vertical integration strategy.

It's Expensive

One of the most obvious downsides to merging parts of the supply chain is the enormous expense. Companies require a huge amount of capital to set up, maintain, and keep factories or manufacturers profitable. And, if the producer itself merges forward, maintaining retail and marketing can be a hefty expense, as well.

More Rigid to Trends

In addition to the expense, vertical integration can make companies less resilient to changes in market trends, given how the supply chain is set up. In this sense, companies that are deeply vertically integrated (have multiple parts of the supply chain combined) often struggle to shift their production to different kinds of products -- or anything that would break ties with their factories. Additionally, vertically-integrated companies are often not able to switch to foreign producers or factories who may have lower operating costs or exchange rates.

Harder to Manage Well

Because vertical integration largely erodes specialization, it can be hard to manage as well due to the different kinds of companies or moving parts within the overarching organization. For example, if a CEO once managed a retail company before deciding to vertically integrate with a manufacturer, they now have to learn how to manage both businesses -- which, as has been seen, is no simple feat (and can often be an enormous challenge).

Corporate Culture Tension

While perhaps not as critical a factor as some of the others, the conflict between retail and manufacturing cultures is still something to consider as a negative to vertical integration. And, it only makes sense that combining well-established cultures that are dichotomous -- like a marketing and sales-driven organization with a production and manufacturing-driven outfit -- can instigate some problems. Additionally, poor management may contribute to communication issues down the long chain of command that inherently comes with combining multiple companies under one head.

Conflicts with Market Entry Barriers

Regardless of how successful a vertically-integrated company is, there are still other concerns that can arise when said company has a dominant position in its market. While controlling production and the market is certainly a plus for vertical integration, it can also lead to the creation of market entry barriers for new companies to access the product space -- which could possibly lead to antitrust issues. By hoarding consumers, large, vertically-integrated companies could potentially face conflict or even retribution for crowding the market.

Vertical vs. Horizontal Integration

While vertical integration is the combining of multiple companies along the same supply chain (as in a raw goods producer with a retailer who will sell the finished product), horizontal integration entails a company acquiring other companies similar to it (often competition) to increase customer base, market size, or diversify its products in the same industry.

Horizontal integration often occurs within the same industry, but may also occur in different or related industries.

Additionally, horizontal integration may occur to increase product differentiation or expand market control. So, while its intention is not necessarily to reduce costs by controlling more of its own supply chain, companies that horizontally integrate often do so in the hopes of increasing consumer base, assets and resources, or increasing revenue.

Still, much as vertical integration is in danger of creating antitrust issues, horizontal integration can spiral into oligopolies, or clusters of companies that comprise the most market share of a certain industry. So, horizontal integration is typically closely watched by the Federal Trade Commission in order to prevent too little competition in an industry.

Some examples of horizontal integration include Facebook's (FB) 2012 acquisition of Instagram (a fellow social media company), or Marriott International's (MAR) 2016 acquisition of Sheraton (both hospitality companies). This is different from the vertical integration that companies do --like Live Nation's (LYV) acquisition of Ticketmaster, which is an example of a company that specializes in the creation and promotion of concerts with a company specializing in selling tickets.

Vertical Integration Examples

While there are countless examples of companies that are vertically integrated, there are several that stand out for their success in harnessing the strategy to their advantage.

Apple

Apple Inc. (APPL) has been very successful in vertically integrating multiple stages of its supply chain to dominate a huge part of the electronic and media product markets. In fact, Apple has been able to produce much of its own LCD screens, custom A-series chips for its iPhones and iPods and ID-fingerprint sensors to use in its products. And, when Apple opened up a 70,000-square-foot, $18.2 billion manufacturing facility in North San Jose in 2015, it kept its supply chain steady and flexible, producing its own products.

Still, Apple has also utilized a forward integration structure as well, keeping a tight hold on its distribution channels -- which, apart from some exceptions like vendor-partner Best Buy, mostly are owned and operated by the company itself. This selective distribution strategy has allowed Apple to achieve enormous margins -- and the company has recently been evaluated as the first $1 trillion company.

Zara

Another strong example of successful vertical integration is mega ""fast-fashion"" giant Zara. While competitors like H&M and The Gap (GPS) have resorted to purchasing clothing from outside suppliers, Zara has been able to combine the design, manufacturing and retail parts of its supply chain to create an ultra-quick production and distribution channel that has allowed them to make and sell many more collections a year than its competitors. In fact, the flexibility that Zara's vertical integration has provided the brand has given it a step up on competitors due to how fast it can turn out new product and go with the flow of consumer trends.

Live Nation and Ticketmaster

Live Nation wisely merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to create a vertically-integrated company Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) that has combined the media promotion of concerts with the sale of tickets to customers. On the Live Nation side, the company manages artists and helps produce and promote shows, while the Ticketmaster side sells tickets to customers. Combined, the vertically-integrated company takes care of both the production and retail sides of the industry -- and has done so successfully. According to Billboard, Live Nation is the biggest promoter in the world.

Still, like many vertically-integrated companies, as it has dominated the ticketing world, the Live Nation-Ticketmaster duo has faced some scrutiny -- notably at the hands of The New York Times.",2018-08-17,

For those of you who like to get out there and fish these waters, these are fish that make for good eating, and generally speaking, are just not equipped to put up much of a fight.

General Electric (GE) is another bottom dweller that seems ill equipped to put up much of a fight. That's not a shot at CEO John Flannery. I think he is digging in and putting up a tremendous effort to save a firm left to him in a horrendous position.

The stock though... (shaking my head). The stock's performance would look at the term ""flat"" as a serious positive. I am long General Electric. I hate being long General Electric. Bottom fishing is not the sport that it's made out to be. Even at these current prices -- the stock closed at $12.30 on Thursday, after trading as low as 11.94 (a nine-year low!) on Wednesday -- I am not likely to add to this position.

Big Seller

Two years ago, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) made its exit from the name, I got in. Hey, big seller out of the way. What could possibly go wrong? Well, I spent about a year and a half managing that position. I did get out in May with my capital investment whole, but it took much of my time and energy. It also took adding a ton of risk in sports that I am comfortable with, such as the sale of both puts and calls, as well as coming close to overplaying my hand in sports that I don't like so much. It's called adding on weakness when you believe in a stock. It's called dollar cost averaging when you go for it on fourth down.

I am not even down on my current position. My equity stake has an average price of $13.16. I had driven my net basis as low as $11.44 through the writing of discounted puts. Then by adding longs on the call side, I actually took my basis up to $11.99. Truth is, I am just plain sick of this name, and sick of working, basically for free just to keep this one from hurting me.

Unwinding my derivative positions will drive my basis higher. I'm stuck for now. I won't be flat anytime soon, but I will lend you my analysis, if you'd like it. I imagine some of you might be long this sickly name with the ""re-emerging"" dividend yield of 3.9%.

Lemonade Stand

When you were a kid, there's chance that your mom bought you and your sister some lemons, and maybe some napkins. You guys used her sugar. You sold the lemonade out on the sidewalk for 5 cents a glass. A few neighbors stopped by. You and your sister evenly split revenue of maybe 50 cents. The whole thing probably cost your Mom a few bucks. Nice trade.

That's what GE is doing with its power conversion unit. Last week, it was reported that Flannery might be looking to sell that unit, perhaps for as much as $3.2 billion. Firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) are mentioned as potential buyers. Immelt spent twice that much to purchase the unit himself back in 2011. Two days earlier, the firm announced that it was selling the energy debt financing business to Starwood Property Trust (STWD) .

GE continues to shed business units despite announcing that the $20 billion divestiture target had been substantially completed last month. Is the firm simpler and stronger as promised? Well, it's still a long way from simpler, and stronger is anybody's guess. The separation of the Baker Hughes (BHGE) oil services unit still lies in the future.

Bottom Line: GE

What you have here is a stock scraping along at nearly oversold conditions, with all three components of the daily MACD in negative territory, and Money Flow that looks like something out of the apocalypse. A series of lower highs is illustrated by the blue line. That line will be tough to crack. GE did try to break out of its downward-sloping Pitchfork in late July, but that effort appears to have failed miserably.

Wall Street's average Target Price for GE is $15.32. However, Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan, in my opinion, has been the most accurate analyst on this name. He has a sell rating on GE and a Wall Street low price target of $11. Obviously, only you know your tolerance for risk. Obviously, downside risk at this point is not what it once was.

How to Trade It

If you can isolate this stock from the rest of your book, and not worry about it, then fine. If you are flat, look somewhere else for fun. My advice is that if you have the time and the energy to babysit this thing, you can probably pull this off. Know what you are getting into, though. There is no easy money to be made in this seemingly cheap name.

Last night, October 19 $11 puts went out at $0.16. GE reports the day prior. Hard to see any value in making that sale. Those long the equity might want to buy those puts though, just in case Tusa is being overly optimistic.

Tesla TSLA, -0.69% stock closed down 2.3% Tuesday, a day stock-market benchmarks rallied toward fresh records in the wake of a U.S.-Mexico agreement that eased trade-war worries. Tesla shares traded as low as $311.19 Tuesday.

Earlier Tuesday, Cannacord analyst Jed Dorsheimer trimmed his third-quarter expectations for Tesla, cast doubt on the company’s ability to remain solvent even as it slowed its cash burn, and cut his price target on the stock to $316 from $336.

That target would represent downside of around 1%. The analyst kept his equivalent of a neutral rating on the stock.

Dorsheimer had tough words about Musk’s announcement Friday that he was keeping Tesla public after all.

The “drama associated with this endeavor, which includes tweeting ‘funding secured,’ is a great example of why even a great company may need different leaders during its life cycle,” he wrote.

While Tesla leads the market with brand and technology, “a series of self-inflicted problems could open the door for new entrants with greater financial backing, such as the Toyota/Uber opportunity, for example,” the analyst said.

Toyota Motor Corp. is said to be about to invest around $500 million in Uber Technologies Inc. and work jointly on driverless cars, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal that cited people familiar with the matter.

Recent “distractions” at Tesla increase the Canaccord Genuity’s risk profile and affect the outlook for Model 3 production, the analyst said.

He trimmed his Model 3 production estimates to 48,000 from 52,000 in the third quarter; Tesla has guided for between 50,000 and 55,000 Model 3 sedans and said it would be profitable in the July-September period.

The Canaccord analyst also worried about Tesla’s cash position. With $2.2 billion in cash at the end of second quarter, Tesla “only has enough cash to maintain operations for another six to nine months at its current rate,” he said.

The company has managed “to stem the flow of cash burn” from $1 billion to roughly $740 million quarter-over-quarter, but has not managed to achieve profitability since a short stint in 2016.

The third quarter “will be especially important, as we will see how the company performs with a full quarter at or above the 5,000 per week milestone for Model 3 production, which ought to bring the company to profitability,” he said.

“With higher performance models and cash buyer Model 3s being prioritized, Tesla will be able to stave off cash concerns in the short-term. However, its coming debt obligations are cause for concern,” said the note.

Tesla has convertible debt coming due, including a $230 million tranche due in November at $560 a share and $920 million due in March at $360 a share, and it will “need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency.”

Tesla’s only pure bonds, the 5.300% notes that mature in August of 2025 were last trading at 87.321 cents on the dollar to yield 7.684%, or at a yield spread of 484 basis points over Treasurys, 7 basis points wider on the week and 42 basis points wider since the start of the month.

The bonds traded above 93 cents on Wednesday at their peak following Musk’s Aug. 1 going-private tweet.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-to-know-about-the-ipo-of-nio-aka-the-chinese-tesla-2018-08-15,"Nio Inc., a Shanghai-based electric-car maker, has filed for an initial public offering, hoping to raise money for an expansion that includes launching a smaller electric SUV to broaden its customer base.

Nio earlier in August filed to offer up to $1.8 billion worth of American depositary shares. On Tuesday, the company set the terms of its IPO, seeking to sell 160 million shares between $6.25 and $8.25 per American depositary share to raise up to $1.52 billion, according to its amended filing.

If Nio succeeds in raising that sum, it would mark the fourth largest U.S. IPO this year, behind Axa Equitable Holdings’ EQH, -0.88% $3.16 billion, PagSeguro Digital’s PAGS, +1.03% $2.6 billion, and iQIYI Inc.’s IQ, -1.05% $2.4 billion.

The company expects to list its ADS on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NIO, and Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters.

Entities affiliated with Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, -1.26% have a 15% stake in Nio, and those affiliated with investment powerhouse Hillhouse Capital another 7.5%, according to the company’s prospectus. Founder and Chief Executive Bin Li holds a 17% stake.

The company will compete with Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.65% in the luxury electric-car market, and mentioned the potential U.S. rival 13 times in its prospectus.

Here are five things to know about Nio ahead of its IPO:

Its name means ‘blue sky coming’

Nio’s Chinese name, Weilai, translates as “blue sky coming.” Li founded the company in 2014, then named NextCar Inc. It changed its name to Nio three years later.

Nio first introduced a “super car,” the EP9, in 2016. It launched its first volume-produced car, the ES8, in December 2017, with deliveries starting in June of this year.

The ES8 is a 7-seater all-aluminum body electric SUV that the company boasts is cheaper in China than Tesla’s Model X.

“Currently we believe no premium BEV is available to Chinese consumers at competitive pricing and the ES8 is expected to face limited competition initially from premium BEVs,” NIO said in the prospectus.

As of the end of July, Nio had delivered 481 ES8s and had unfulfilled reservations for more than 17,000 ES8s with deposits, according to the prospectus.

Nio plans to launch its second vehicle, the ES6, by the end of 2018, and start deliveries in the first half of next year. The ES6 is a 5-seater, “high-performance premium electric SUV, set at a lower price point than the ES8 to target a broader customer base,” NIO said in the filing.

Nio had a fairly standard warning about the ES6 in the filing, saying it “may not successfully develop the ES6. Our vehicles may not meet customer expectations and our future models, including the ES6, may not be commercially viable.”

No revenue until this year

Nio has more in common with Tesla than ambition: it also has lost massive amounts of money and burned through piles of cash — part of the reason it plans to go public.

“We have negative cash flows from operation, have only recently started to generate revenues and have not been profitable, all of which may continue in the future,” it warned.

Nio began showing revenue this year, reporting $6.7 million in vehicle sales and $7 million in total revenue for the first six months of 2018, when net losses topped $502 million. The company reported a net loss of $758.8 million for all of 2017.

Through June, Nio had burned through $549 million in cash to operate, compared with $691 million for all of 2017. Capital expenditures hit $163 million in the first six months of this year, compared with $168 million for all of last year.

The company estimates that its capital expenditures for the next three years will reach about $1.8 billion. That includes money for improvements and installation of equipment at a plant in Shanghai, as well as for research and development and the expansion of its sales and service network. It expects to incur about $600 million of that in the 12 months starting July 2018.

Nio’s total borrowings, as of June, reached $189.9 million, mainly bank loans and a loan from its investors, said the prospectus.

‘Limited experience’ in making cars

There is no dearth of risks listed in Nio’s prospectus, and such risks are familiar to anyone who has spent any time reading about Tesla: “Our ability to develop and manufacture a car of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven and still evolving,” it said of risks relating to business.

Nio admits it has “limited experience” so far in high-volume manufacturing of electric vehicles.

“We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop efficient, automated, cost-efficient manufacturing capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes required to successfully mass market the ES8 and future vehicles,” it said.

Then there are the suppliers. The ES8 uses more than 1,700 purchased parts which Nio buys from more than 160 suppliers. Many of those are single-source suppliers for these components, and the company is expecting that this will be similar for the ES6 and any other future vehicle it may produce.

“The supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages,” says the prospectus.

The company is also highly dependent on government incentives and policies that are favorable for electric vehicles.

Its business could be affected by trade wars

Nio said its business could be “adversely affected” by trade tariffs or other trade barriers, including U.S. tariffs imposed in March on steel and aluminum and additional tariffs targeting Chinese goods.

Nio does not export any products to the U.S. and it is not yet clear what impact these tariffs could have. It intends to sell its cars only in China at least in the near future, but tariffs could potentially impact raw-material prices, it said.

Unusual—and risky—corporate structure

Like many Chinese companies with listings outside of China, Nio is a variable-interest entity, or VIE, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for Chinese companies that are not allowed to have direct foreign ownership.

Under the VIE structure, the Chinese company creates two entities, one in China that holds the permits and licenses needed to do business there and the other an offshore entity, in this case in the Cayman Islands, in which foreign investors can buy shares. The Chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements.

The biggest example of a VIE is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in which the Chinese entity is wholly owned by its founder and chairman, Jack Ma.

The risk with this setup is that foreign investors don’t actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the Chinese government could decide or force a split with the listed company, leaving U.S. investors high and dry.

“It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide,” the company warns in its prospectus.

As an “emerging growth” company, Nio has to follow fewer reporting and other requirements.

Musk on Friday announced that the company was abandoning the attempt to go private, which he had unveiled in a tweet that came with the assurance ""funding secured."" The tweet has attracted scrutiny from the SEC and lawsuits from shareholders, after the funding appeared questionable and created volatility in the stock. ""What was at best a premature announcement has generated three weeks of distraction from one of Tesla's most important quarters to date,"" wrote Dorsheimer. Canaccord reiterated its hold rating, cut its stock price target for Tesla to $316 from $336 and trimmed its Model 3 production estimates to 48K from 52K. Tesla shares were down 0.5% premarket, but have gained 2.5% in 2018, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% has gained 8.4%.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-drops-after-musk-axes-go-private-plan-but-baird-analyst-sees-a-silver-lining-2018-08-27,"Tesla Inc. shares dropped on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk backed out of his plan to take the Silicon Valley car maker private, and Wall Street remained divided about the stock.

Tesla TSLA, -0.72% lost as much as 4% in early trading and suffered steeper losses in the premarket after closing Friday at $322.82. They pared losses, however, as the trading day progressed to close down 1.1% at $319.27.

Tossing yet another curveball at investors, Musk announced in a blog late Friday that he had concluded taking Tesla private was too complicated and distracting, and that it was “better off as a public company.”

Shares have been on a roller-coaster ride since Musk floated the idea of privatization in an Aug. 7 tweet, which reportedly has sparked a Securities and Exchange investigation. They rallied 11% on that day to close at $379.57; they are off 16% from that peak and off nearly 7% from the close on the day before the tweet.

Tesla shares since Aug. 7 tweet by Musk

Weighing in on Monday, Baird analyst Ben Kallo, a longtime Tesla bull, said investors should expect Tesla shares to come under pressure in the near term as they question the outcome of staying public, but that there was a silver lining.

“That said, we expect shares to appreciate over the intermediate term as the focus shifts back to fundamentals, which we believe may be underappreciated,” he said.

He added that Baird would recommend buying Tesla on any weakness, given it expects a move higher ahead of third-quarter deliveries and results, including a potential bump from Tesla appearing to have made “significant progress on the Model 3 production ramp.”

Baird analysts have held an outperform rating on Tesla since early 2016, with a current price target of $411. Shortly after Musk floated the idea of a $420-a-share buyout, the analysts predicted shares would go even higher, though they’ve never reached beyond an intraday high of $387.46 on Aug. 7.

Among the clouds the Baird analyst said he sees hanging over Tesla are a potential SEC penalty, though he thinks the risks on that may be overblown, and that concerns about potential funding may resurface.

Both bulls and bears “will be happy to see Tesla remain public, and the stock debate for the ages will rage on,” analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note Monday. The going-private talks have proven to be a “three-week distraction that really did not need to take place in the public domain,” they said.

It remains to be seen if regulators continue their investigations into the original tweet, and “we see no reason they won’t,” the Evercore ISI analysts said.

As far as Musk’s Twitter habit, “the negatives outweigh the positives and that this is something that the board should give serious consideration to placing controls around going forward, if they have not done so already,” they said.

Analysts at CreditSights, who focus on company debt, said the three-week “’go-private’ drama further underscored the risks associated with Musk’s “singularly influencing the direction of the company.”

There will now be lingering lawsuits over the coming months that add “to the already long laundry list of risks and bad PR on governance,” they said.

Analysts at CFRA cut their price target on the Tesla stock to $325 from $380, removing not only the premium added for the potential going-private transaction but also “a valuation penalty ($25 per share) that we asses for reduced management creditability and increased legal risk (SEC investigations and investor lawsuits) and distraction,” they said.

Musk is also taking some heat for his disclosure about not taking the company private coming out close to midnight on Friday evening, as opposed to the timing of the early August go-public teaser tweet, which came in the middle of the trading day.

“Releasing important news after 6 p.m. on a Friday is generally left to penny stocks and promoters, not companies worth $55 billion,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, in a note to clients.

“After so many missteps from the Q1 conference call to the potentially fraudulent and manipulative privatization tweet, one would think the Board would have at least requested this disclosure in a professional manner,” he said, adding that such behavior is often “ruthlessly punished by markets.”

“The traditional thinking is that when the company’s leadership clearly exhibits that the investors’ interests are second to their own, shareholders should not be surprised when the next shoe drops,” said O’Rourke.

Tesla shares have gained 0.4% in 2018, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.08% has gained 8.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.09% has gained 5.2%.

It is also the first time the Nasdaq traded above 8,000, taking the tech-laden index 164 trading days to rise 1,000 points from 7,000. It marks the second 1,000-point advance for the Nasdaq this year, something that has not happened since 1999.

How did the main benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% jumped 259.29 points, or 1%, to 26,049.64 after the blue-chip index successfully reclaimed the psychologically-important 26,000 mark for the first time since February.

What factors drove the market?

The U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement to enter into a new trade deal as President Donald Trump announced that he wants to drop the name “North American Free Trade Agreement” from an existing deal that includes Canada.

The Trump administration has levied multiple tariffs and other protectionist measures against a number of key U.S. trading partners, including the European Union and China. Many investors fear the prospect of a full-on trade war, and see a resolution of the tensions as the market’s biggest potential upside catalyst.

The market’s rally comes after comments Friday from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who affirmed last week that the U.S. central bank would continue its strategy of gradually normalizing its monetary policy.

The sense that the economy remains on a solid footing has allowed Wall Street to shrug off all kinds of headwinds and negative headlines, including uncertainty over trade policy, signs of weakness in the housing market, the difficulties in Turkey’s economy and the legal issues surrounding Trump.

Don’t miss: Here’s why stocks are focused almost exclusively on trade, in one chart

On the economic-data front, a measure of the U.S. economy from the Chicago Federal Reserve slowed in July from June’s robust performance, owed in large part to lighter output at the nation’s factories. The Chicago Fed’s index of national economic activity registered at a positive 0.13 last month, down from an upwardly revised positive 0.48 in June.

What were analysts saying?

“Obviously, it’s about Nafta and it’s about trade,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. Engelke said he was “extremely optimistic about the [domestic] economy, but neutral about the indexes.” That means he expects coming to moves to lend themselves to an environment in which stock pickers, rather than indexes, outperform.

“This coming week is the second-most-vacationed week of the year in the New York area (behind Christmas week), so we expect generally quiet markets (though upside momentum may well carry them higher into month’s end on Friday),” said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Strategies.

What stocks were in focus?

Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.95% shares fell 1.1% after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk late Friday said the electric-car maker would remain a public company. Musk was nagged by lingering doubts and unexpected difficulties for his plan to take Tesla private, a plan he unexpectedly announced over Twitter, according to The Wall Street Journal. The stock is up 1.7% this year, with the going-private announcement a catalyst for recent gains. It is up nearly 16% over the past three months.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -0.95% shares slid 4.8% after an analyst at Wedbush lowered the stock to underperform from neutral and cut its price target to $445 from $450.

VMware Inc. VMW, -0.35% shares fell 0.9% after the company said it plans to buy startup CloudHealth, a software platform that lets companies juggle different public cloud vendors. VMware did not disclose a price for the deal in its announcement, but Reuters reported that VMware would pay roughly $500 million.

Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.80% rallied 4.7%, extending gains for a fifth session in line with the general strength in technology stocks. Twitter has recouped most of its losses from a month earlier when it tanked after the company issued a weak outlook.

‘The corporate-governance disaster that is Tesla continues. Keep in mind that Musk informed the board on Thursday, according to his Friday night post.’ Jim Chanos

Musk in a blog post wrote on Friday that “given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.”

Musk stunned fans and critics of Tesla TSLA, -0.87% alike on Aug. 7 when he announced plans to take the car manufacturer private at $420 a share, describing that he had “funding secured,” suggesting that the process was in its later stages.

The controversial announcement set off a firestorm that reportedly sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a host of investor lawsuits, with questions swirling about the CEO’s intentions.

Chanos is no fan of Tesla. On the day of Musk’s go-private Twitter missive, the famed short seller — meaning that he places wagers that come good only when a company’s shares lose value — said the bounce that Tesla enjoys from bearish investors being squeezed is the only positive narrative that the company has: “The short position is the best thing the stock has going for it. ‘Musk vs. The Shorts’ is a far better narrative than ‘Tesla vs. Mercedes/Audi/Porsche,’ ” Chanos told CNBC.

Tesla’s stock rose 11% to $379.57 on the day Musk tweeted about his plan. But since that point it has been less buoyant, with shares sinking by 5.8% as of Friday’s close.

That said, Tesla shares haven’t been a short-seller paradise.

So far this year, they have climbed 3.7%, and the stock performance thus far in August puts shares on track for a gain of 8.3%, according to FactSet data. By comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% has gained 2.1% in August and is on track to climb by 7.5% in the first eight months of 2018, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% has advanced 1.5% this month so far and 4.3% to this point in 2018.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lingering-doubts-harsh-realities-ended-elon-musks-plan-to-take-tesla-private-2018-08-26,"Elon Musk was nagged by lingering doubts and unexpected difficulties for his plan to take Tesla Inc. private, which led to his surprise announcement late Friday night that the electric-car maker would remain a public company, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.

Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, told the board of directors Thursday that he was no longer pursuing the deal, the Journal said.

While Musk believed he had enough funding available to go private, the buyout would have forced out some of his most supportive mutual-fund investors, potentially to be replaced by rival car-makers, the Journal reported, and it would likely have replaced small investors — many of whom were electric-car fanatics — with larger, institutional investors.

Musk told the Journal that it was unlikely Tesla would try — or be able — to go private in the future:

‘In my opinion, the value of Tesla will rise considerably in the coming months and years, possibly putting any take-private beyond the reach of any investors. It was now or perhaps never.’ Elon Musk, in an email to the Wall Street Journal

In an article that detailed how Musk’s go-private plan unraveled, the Journal said “Musk seemed to view such a complex corporate transaction as an engineering problem he could solve,” but eventually soured on the strings that would be attached to private investments.

Read: ‘The corporate-governance disaster that is Tesla continues,’ says one of the fiercest critics of Musk and Co.

Tesla’s board, which was wary of the go-private plan to begin with, was apparently relieved when Musk scuttled it, with one board member saying, “Woohoo,” the Journal reported.

The California Highway Patrol said the car rear-ended a fire engine that had stopped on the far-right lane of heavily trafficked Highway 101 with its flashing lights on around 1 a.m.

“I think I had Autopilot on,” the driver told officers, according to a statement from the CHP.

Emergency responders could not immediately confirm whether the Autopilot feature was in fact engaged. A Tesla spokesperson said Sunday the electric-car company “has not yet received any data from the car, but we are working to establish the facts of the incident.”

Read: Elon Musk says Tesla will remain a public company, and he will run it

Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.87% has, in the past, stressed that its Autopilot is not designed to prevent all collisions and that drivers “are responsible to keep their hands on the wheel and remain alert and present when using Autopilot.”

The driver and a passenger suffered minor injuries. The driver was briefly hospitalized and then arrested for suspected drunken driving, the CHP said.

The use of Tesla’s Autopilot has been investigated in a number of high-profile crashes in recent years. In May, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into a Tesla Model S sedan that was reportedly using Autopilot when it rear-ended a fire engine in South Jordan, Utah.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-model-3-finish-is-below-average-analyst-says-2018-08-23,"Analysts at UBS found more to fault with Tesla Inc.’s Model 3, saying the electric sedan they scrutinized “performed poorly” in terms of finishing quality, sporting missing bolts and uneven welding.

The analysts, led by Colin Langan, have performed a “complete teardown” of a Model 3 alongside engineering partners and last week, in a first note about that process, said Tesla TSLA, -0.87% could stand to lose about $6,000 on every cheaper, base-version Model 3 it will sell because the car’s powertrain isn’t as cheap as expected.

This week’s note focused on the car’s finishing versus other mass-market electric vehicles, and said it “stumbles” in comparison with General Motors Co. GM, -0.72% Chevy Bolt and BMW’s BMW, -0.88% i3. The analysts said they found “significant fit & finish issues” with the Model 3 that would be expensive to fix.

“Our teardown experts noted numerous Model 3 quality issues including inconsistent gaps (and) flushness throughout the car, missing bolts, loose tolerances, and uneven (and) misaligned spot welds,” the analysts said in the note.

As of April, the standard deviation of all gaps and offsets across the entire car had already improved by nearly 40% on average, with particular gap improvements visible in the area of the trunk, rear lamps and rear quarter panel, a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement.

“Today, Model 3 panel gaps are competitive with Audi, BMW, and Mercedes models, but in the spirit of relentless improvement, we are working to make them even tighter. Our goal is to produce a perfect car for every customer,” the spokesperson said.

Customer satisfaction scores for the Model 3 have averaged about 90% since January, “with steady improvement through the year, even as the number of cars delivered has rapidly multiplied,” the spokesperson said. If customers are unhappy with their car, “they can either give it back for a full refund, allow us to address any issues, or ask for an entirely new Tesla.”

The UBS analysts have based their assumptions on a teardown of a higher-end Model 3, costing $49,000, which included a pricier battery option and a higher-end trim.

The teardown experts provided a “full breakdown” of the electric vehicles’ major components, including powertrain and battery, controlling electronics, and body and chassis, with each component removed and scrutinized.

Read more: Elon Musk left plenty of questions about Tesla going private, experts say

“The car scored ‘below average’ on the fit & finish quality audit,” and the team also found it “borderline acceptable” in terms of noise.

The results confirm media reports of quality issues and are “disappointing” in a $49,000 car, the analysts said. They stripped a 2017 Model 3, and while Tesla has acknowledged quality issues with earlier Model 3 vehicles, it now claims quality is on par with Model S and Model X vehicles, UBS said.

The analysts said they reached out to manufacturing experts including former Tesla employees to understand how the problems they uncovered could be fixed.

The conclusion was that gaps and noise problems “are very difficult (and) time consuming fixes,” they said. While cosmetic fixes can hide some flaws, “truly fixing” them requires tracing the process back and likely replacing stamping molds, they said.

The last leg of UBS’ teardown also unveiled service concerns, the analysts said.

Being an electric vehicle, the Model 3 in “inherently more difficult to service,” but in its specific case the battery pack, glued and screwed together and then secured to the car’s floor with 48 bolts, looks difficult to access, they said.

In a separate note earlier this week, the UBS analysts had praised the Model 3’s electronics, saying it had given them a “look into future” electronic architectures better suited for the more intense use of advanced diver-assistance systems and future driverless capabilities.

They tempered that enthusiasm, however, by noting the car’s electronic architecture adds complexity to its assembly and for now it looks as if it wouldn’t be able to handle high-automation levels on its way toward full automation.

“Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company,” Musk wrote in a Tesla blog post. “I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it’s clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated.

“After considering all of these factors, I met with Tesla’s board of directors yesterday and let them know that I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public. The board indicated that they agree.”

Musk stunned Wall Street on Aug. 7 with a tweet that said he was considering taking Tesla TSLA, -1.11% private at $420 a share, with “funding secured,” a move that has reportedly sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In his blog post, Musk said “my belief that there is more than enough funding to take Tesla private was reinforced during this process.”

Earlier: Elon Musk describes ‘excruciating’ year, says ‘worst is yet to come’

A committee of Tesla board members built to explore privatization issued a statement that confirmed Musk’s post, and said the board supported Musk’s continued stewardship of the company.

“The board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla’s operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward,” it read.

At the end of his post, Musk also said that he intends to continue running Tesla amid a potential SEC investigation into his actions.

“I’m incredibly excited to continue leading Tesla as a public company,” Musk said in closing. “It is a privilege.”

After the blog post hit just before midnight Eastern on Friday night in a New York Times story, Musk did not tweet about it. He instead tweeted about his rocket company, SpaceX, and hyperloops.

The number of these electric cars being stolen has steadily increased every year along with production: 6 in 2013, 15 in 2014, 9 in 2015, 28 in 2016, 57 in 2017 and 23 from January to May 2018. And yet almost every stolen Tesla over those years has been recovered — all except 3, including that sole Tesla stolen in 2011. (Tesla did not respond to request for comment.)

The recovery of stolen Teslas is notable in an industry where the overall recovery rate for stolen vehicles was just 58.4% in 2016. Tesla had a 100% recovery rate that year, thanks in part to its GPS tracking technology. “That’s about as good as it gets,” said Fank Scafidi, director of public affairs at the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which crunched the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Crime Information Center data. “I’m wondering if the thieves’ intellect might have been overwhelmed just sitting in a Tesla, much less figuring out how to operate it for any length of time.”

“The actual ability to get into a Tesla would be somewhat difficult as you’d have to hack your way in,” says Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. “Most of the top 10 stolen vehicles in the U.S. tend to be mass-market models. They’re primarily stolen for body parts and air bags, and anything thieves can sell to service shops.” The more Teslas sold, he said, the more thieves will seek valuable spare parts. “It will be interesting to see what model becomes a hot commodity for thieves now that there are more Model 3 and Model Ss out there.”

The number of stolen Teslas in the U.S. has spiked in recent years, reaching an annual peak of 57 in 2017 (with all but one of those cars recovered) as the electric-car manufacturer has ramped up production. Tesla delivered 76,000 vehicles in 2016 and 103,000 in 2017. Last month, Tesla reported that it produced 53,339 vehicles in the second quarter alone and said it expects to make 6,000 Model 3s per week by late August. It delivered 28,578 Model 3s, compared to 24,761 Model S and Model X cars combined.

The recovery of stolen Teslas is notable in an industry where the recovery rate for stolen vehicles was 58.4% in 2016. Tesla had a 100% recovery rate that year.

There’s been a spate of “relay attacks” in recent years where thieves unlocked key fobs remotely. Last month, Tesla emailed customers to ask them to change their settings: “When enabled, our passive entry setting will automatically unlock the doors of your Model S when you approach it with your key. Relay attacks, a type of vehicle break-in that can be targeted at vehicles from many manufacturers including Tesla, allow an attacker to transmit a signal from your key in one location to your car in another location, thereby creating the potential for unauthorized access and entry.”

Tesla’s remote software updates have aimed to keep pace with its increasingly prolific production line. It’s no mean feat to get a stolen Tesla across state lines or even spirit it out of the country, DeLorenzo said. “You have to be able to recharge the car,” he added, “and you need pin numbers.” The thief would also need to stop at a recharging station, which are concentrated along the east and west coasts. “As time goes on, the value of Tesla parts the value will go up exponentially,” he added. But, just like tracing an iPhone, he expects Tesla’s GPS technology to keep track of them too.

Tesla’s not alone. OnStar, a subsidiary of General Motors GM, -0.71% has assisted police with 100,000 stolen vehicles since 1996, although it can’t say for sure that all of those cars were recovered. In 2008, it introduced a feature that remotely slows down a stolen vehicle in a high-speed car chase. “A lot of thieves don’t know this technology is in our vehicles, so I can imagine their faces when the car starts to slow down,” said Stefan Cross, a spokesman for General Motors. “It’s been used about a 1,000 times since the launch and we’re averaging 22 a month right now.”

Stealing automobiles remains a big business in the U.S. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates the value of stolen vehicles at $6 billion, up from $4.5 billion in 2014. It says a motor vehicle is stolen every 41 seconds. The most popular vehicle parts and items range from doors, engines, transmissions and GPS units to cell phones, iPads and laptops. More than 765,000 cars are stolen each year, down from nearly a million vehicles a year a decade ago, thanks in a large part due the key fob technology that makes cars increasingly difficult to break into.

Federal Reserve bossman Jay Powell may talk about fighting the next recession, after the Dallas Fed’s chief buckaroo shared his dream of getting interest rates up near 2.75%, while St. Looey’s backed standing pat.

Their Wyoming musings come in a week that’s seen the S&P score its first record intraday high since January, as well as deliver arguably the longest bull market ever.

So you might be wondering: What’s the takeaway for investors from this record-busting action?

It can feel really hard to jump into U.S. stocks around a new peak, but it has paid off historically, say Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Josh Brown and Bill Sweet for our call of the day.

When prices have never been higher, it’s psychologically difficult to buy, they note.

“It’s the worst feeling on earth, until three years later,” says Brown, in a YouTube video recorded with Sweet. “The only feeling worse is if you don’t.”

The duo trots out all sorts of historical data to support their upbeat view.

Looking at the Dow’s action over roughly a century, Brown and Sweet point out the blue-chip gauge has averaged a dozen new highs a year. In other words, it’s not so rare and scary. As Sweet puts it: “One per month.”

On average after notching a fresh peak, the Dow is up 32% five years later, they add.

“Not a lot of people think, ‘I’m going to buy an all-time high and on average, five years from now, I can expect to see the market a third higher,’” says Brown, known for his Reformed Broker blog. “But that’s actually what the experience has been over the last 100 years.”

The S&P 500 on Tuesday traded at a record intraday high above 2,873.

Brown and Sweet also emphasize that when stocks hit an all-time high in any one month, they have a 90% chance of achieving another record within four months.

“90% — does it get better than that in investing probability?” Brown says. “If you have this ‘Gambler’s Fallacy,’ where you see a new high and your immediate reaction is, ‘Well, that’s the top,’ it literally works in the opposite direction.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fire-breaks-out-at-tesla-factory-in-fremont-2018-08-23,"A small fire broke out late Thursday at Tesla Inc.’s auto factory in Fremont, Calif., sending a plume of black smoke into the air but causing no injuries and not affecting production.

The Fremont Fire Department confirmed it responded to the blaze, which threatened a structure and started a small grass fire before it was extinguished. The fire broke out around 5:20 p.m. Pacific time.

“This evening, some cardboard and shipping materials being prepared for recycling on our southern fence line caught fire, along with a small patch of grass next to a Tesla parking lot,” a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. “The fire is now contained. We would like to thank the Fremont Fire Department for their rapid response. There are no injuries and we are investigating the cause.”

Images from TV showed damage to a tent-like structure apparently used for recycling. A Tesla spokesperson said it was not the tent used for Model 3 production. and that the fire was not near the production structure.

I was just there. Cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. Super appreciate fast response by Fremont fire dept! No injuries or damage to factory. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 24, 2018

In June, a similar fire broke out at a cardboard baling machine used for recycling.

Earlier this year, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health reportedly investigated reports of workplace hazards at the factory. In June, Chief Executive Elon Musk accused an employee of sabotaging operations at the factory, and warned employees in a memo to be on the lookout for potential saboteurs.

About 10,000 workers are employed at the plant, which includes a number of buildings on a 370-acre site.

In recent months, Tesla has been ramping up production of its Model 3 sedans, and it aims to roll out 6,000 new cars each week by the end of August. Musk has described the year as “excruciating,” but recently told the New York Times that “the worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.”

Musk is currently being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potentially misleading investors about Model 3 production as well as his plans to take the company private.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chicago-mulls-sale-of-debt-to-fill-pension-funding-hole-heres-why-its-a-bad-idea-2018-08-21,"As Chicago considers a multibillion sale of pension obligation bonds, analysts say such bonds have rarely succeeded at topping up unfunded public pensions, and are historically linked to fiscal stress and municipal debt defaults.

“Generally, most muni analytics folks don’t look upon pension bonds favorably,” said Alan Schankel, municipal strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.

Pension obligation bonds, or POBs, have been connected with high-profile municipal defaults in California’s San Bernadino and Stockton, as well as Detroit. At the state level, issuers of POBs including New Jersey and Connecticut, and the territory of Puerto Rico, have seen a decline in their pension funding ratios and suffered downgrades to their credit rating as a result, noted analysts at Municipal Market Analytics. Illinois, in fact, issued pension bonds in 2003 that only temporarily brought up funded ratios.

Read: Be wary of pension obligation bonds

‘The challenge is investing the proceeds of pension bonds in some kind of investment that will beat your return bogey.’ —Alan Schankel, municipal strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott

Chicago is contemplating a bond sale of $10 billion to help pay down its $28 billion of unfunded pension liabilities. Its exploration of such a deal speaks to the city’s dire financial straits. Chicago’s general obligation bond ratings range from junk, in large part because of the pension burden, to single-A among the major credit ratings agencies, and it has struggled to fill budget gaps beyond pensions.

Last Tuesday, the city’s Chief Financial Officer Carole Brown, citing low-but-rising interest rates, said she would make a decision yet this month on whether to recommend issuing POBs, drawing criticism from municipal finance analysts and academics.

Taking advantage of historically low interest rates, the proponents of pension obligation bonds say local and state governments can borrow at a rate less than the expected returns of their pension funds. This difference can be used to top up the unfunded pension liabilities without having to raise taxes.

But investment returns are fickle, and historically overstated. According to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, the average public plan said it would deliver 7.56% annually as of February but the realized annual returns from 2001 to 2016 have been closer to 5.5%. Linked to the ups and downs of financial markets, public pension returns are rarely high enough on a regular basis for municipal governments to consistently exploit the difference between expected returns and borrowing costs.

“The challenge is investing the proceeds of pension bonds in some kind of investment that will beat your return bogey,” said Schankel.

And if pension funds fail to hit their return targets, the city will be saddled with both the unfunded pension liabilities and the costs of financing the new pension bond debt.

Chicago mayoral candidate Paul Vallas, who, among others, is challenging sitting mayor Rahm Emanuel in a 2019 race, said issuing pension bonds resembled “mortgaging your home and future paychecks to pay off your credit cards.” He has called for public hearings.

Designed as a tool of fiscal prudence, POB use has emerged as a last resort for desperate governments struggling to keep their pension liabilities running out of control.

“The issuance of pension bonds tends to be harbinger of distress. It could tarnish an issuer’s financial image, to that extent,” said Schankel.

Growing understanding of the risks of have led many municipalities to curtail their use. Issuance of POBs have fallen from more than $20 billion in the 2000-2004 period, to around $5 billion from 2015 until now, data from Municipal Market Analytics show.

MMA Sales of pension obligation debt is on the decline.

Aside from questions over their viability, a sale of pension obligation bonds could hurt the city’s fiscal flexibility. To service a looming bond payment, it could mean the city would have to cut down on social programs. With only unfunded pension liabilities on the books, the city can currently shift the timing of its regular pension contributions to avoid that dilemma.

“[Pension bonds] swap relatively flexible pension payments for the hard and fast terms of a bond, where you have to make interest and principal payments,” said Schankel.

The recent clamor over the potential sale of pension bonds have thrown the spotlight on a Chicago government already under financial scrutiny. The city’s budget deficit is projected to increase from $114 million in 2018 to $212.7 million in 2019 and to $330.3 million in 2020, according to the city’s annual financial analysis report.

“The mayor has been clear” in dedicating his second term to stabilizing the city’s fiscal foundation, Brown said in announcing her consideration, according to the Bond Buyer. “If I make a recommendation to proceed it’s because we have figured out a structure that is beneficial to the city.”

Playing it safe with the city’s finances isn’t necessarily the current tack of the mayor’s office. Discussions between Tesla TSLA, -0.87% CEO and founder of the Boring Co. Elon Musk and Emanuel about digging an express tunnel from O’Hare airport to downtown to woo business development have come under criticism, especially absent more plan details. Details that, critics say, could reveal added stress to the city’s fiscal woes.

Yet despite the city’s beleaguered finances, the growth prospects from its young population, on top of relatively attractive yields and scant muni-market competition mean that investors are likely to snap up the bonds.

Fresh issuance in the municipal bond market has fallen thanks to recent changes to the tax code, which eliminated the tax exemption for advanced refunding bonds used to refinance municipal debt at lower rates.

Chicago’s last batch of general obligation bonds sold in February currently yield slightly above 4%, well below the 6% seen at issue time, as their prices have climbed, according to data from EMMA.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/saudis-call-off-aramco-ipo-report-2018-08-22,"Saudi Arabia has called off the domestic and international initial public offerings of state oil company Aramco, according to a Reuters report that cited four unnamed senior industry sources.

Teams of financial advisers working on the proposed IPO have been disbanded, the report said.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the preparations for Aramco’s public listing had stalled amid fears of the heightened public scrutiny that being public would bring to the oil company.

The IPO, which was expected to raise $100 billion and create the largest publicly traded company ever, was first proposed in 2016. It was also meant to be a key component of Saudi Arabia’s plan to diversify away from oil.

That means no scenes from a Jerusalem speakeasy. No “motherf%^$# mashed potato” captions. No previews of SpaceX spacesuits.

And they can forget about those candid date-night shots.

Perhaps the Tesla TSLA, -0.87% boss is taking the next step toward minimizing his mercurial social presence by shutting down his popular Insta account. After all, he shuttered some of his companies’ Facebook pages earlier this year, saying Facebook FB, -0.40% which owns Instagram, gave him “the willies.”

The timing, however, has some tongues on the internet wagging.

The vanishing of his account comes amid unfolding drama involving Musk, the musician Grimes, who has been dating Musk, and rapper Azealia Banks.

‘I’m like in tears right now.’ Azealia Banks

It started last week when Banks said she’d been hanging out at Musk’s house and, according to Business Insider, she overheard him “scrounging for investors” after his infamous “funding secured” tweet about taking Tesla private.

Banks was back at it Monday on Insta. She tagged Musk in a post, saying she needs her phone back and that he needs to contact her ASAP.

Then this tweet from Cheddar reporter Hope King captures the message in a deleted post in which Banks supposedly claims Musk’s lawyer paid off hers.

You up?



Latest from Ms. Banks pic.twitter.com/PA92P8h512 — Hope King (@lisahopeking) August 21, 2018

Banks also recorded herself ranting about how she didn’t want to be in the “middle of this sh*t” anymore and just wanted to return to New York. She went on to tell Business Insider via Instagram that “It’s a f---ing mess I want my phone and I want to go home... I’m like in tears right now.”

Before all this, Musk and Grimes unfollowed each other on Instagram, triggering rumors of a breakup.

A spokesperson for Musk declined to comment for the story.

Meanwhile, Musk clearly has more important matters to attend to, at least in the eyes of investors. At last check, Tesla shares were up more than 3%, but it’s been a brutal run over the past few weeks as questions continue to mount.

A recent survey sent privately by a well-regarded automotive supplier association to top executives found that 18 of 22 respondents believe that Tesla is now a financial risk to their companies, according to the Wall Street Journal.

No doubt, it’s been a difficult emotional stretch for Musk, who gave a candid interview to the New York Times NYT, +0.10% last week in which he went into full detail about his “excruciating” year.

TSLA, -0.87% shares to their equivalent of neutral, saying that shares are likely to remain rangebound as the company sorts out ongoing probes and its leadership. Consumer Edge also cut its price target on the stock to $311 from $385. The analysts said they assign a ""very low chance"" Tesla will go private, and called for a leadership change. Tesla ""may be at a turning point that requires distancing Elon from some of his corporate responsibilities,"" they said, allowing him to focus on revolutionizing production, distribution, operation, and car connectivity. ""We believe hiring a seasoned COO or even CEO would relieve Elon of some of the day-to-day pressures,"" they said. Tesla shares have added 2.3% this year, compared with 7.2% gains for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% in the same period.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-battered-afresh-as-jp-morgan-slashes-price-target-2018-08-20,"Tesla Inc. shares reversed course Monday after spending most of the session in the red following a price target cut by JP Morgan to $195 from $308, putting it back where the investment bank’s target stood on Aug. 8, before Chief Executive Elon Musk’s now famous going-private tweet.

Analysts led by Ryan Brinkman had boosted their price target on Tesla after that tweet, which said Musk was considering taking the company private at $420, with “funding secured.” The analysts now believe the money isn’t there.

Tesla TSLA, -0.87% stock traded as low as $288.20 Monday, its lowest intraday since July 30, but snapped a four-day losing streak to end 1% higher at $308.44.

Adding to Tesla’s woes, over the weekend Reuters reported that deep-pocketed Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund is in talks to invest in Lucid Motors Inc., which hopes to start making electric cars this year. The report cited people familiar with the matter.

In a blog post last week, Musk detailed meetings with fund’s representatives and said he was led to believe the fund could provide money for a going-private deal.

In his note Monday, Brinkman said that while Musk’s “funding secured” tweet offered no further details, he was responding to what he called “declarative statements” from the head of a public company, which should be taken seriously.

“Our interpretation of subsequent events leads us to believe that funding was not secured for a going private transaction, nor was there any formal proposal,” said Brinkman.

Specifically, he noted that Musk said that the Saudi Arabian sovereign-wealth fund had expressed support for such a deal, but then followed that up by saying that the Saudis were seeking additional information, including on how a going-private transaction would be structured.

That suggests that a deal “is potentially far from even being formally proposed, which is different from our understanding on August 8 which was based on Mr. Musk’s statement on Twitter that, only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote,” said Brinkman.

Tesla has become the subject of lawsuits from short and long sellers because of the volatility in the stock since the tweet and the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.

Brinkman conceded that Tesla does seem to exploring a going-private transaction, “but we now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed (more along the lines of high level intention), suggesting formal incorporation into our valuation analysis seems premature at this time.”

Optimism that progress would be made toward resolving contentious trade disputes between the U.S. and China also bolstered sentiment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.06% added 89.37 points, or 0.4%, to finish at 25,758.69, with Nike Inc. NKE, -0.19% rising 3.1% to hit a 52-week high.

What factors were driving the market?

PepsiCo Inc. plans to buy SodaStream International Ltd. for $3.2 billion and Tyson Foods will buy Keystone Foods for $2.16 billion in cash.

Stocks remained buoyed following a report by The Wall Street Journal on Friday that negotiators from the U.S. and China were mapping out talks with the aim of resolving the trade dispute by November. Such an outcome would remove a huge overhang of uncertainty over the markets. The news spurred big gains in Asian markets.

However, this week will also see the imposition of 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese imports, an action by the Trump administration that China has said it would retaliate against.

Stocks trimmed gains just ahead of the closing bell, after Reuters reported that President Donald Trump, in an interview, escalated his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and higher interest rates. Bloomberg had previously reported that Trump had criticized Powell for higher rates in remarks to donors at a fundraiser.

Investors are also paying close attention to troubled regions like Turkey, where the lira and stock market have tumbled amid high inflation, political instability, and debt, and Italy, which is struggling under a debt burden of its own.

Opinion: If turmoil spreads in Europe, expect heavy flows into U.S. stocks

Looking ahead, Wednesday will see the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting, which could provide insight into the central bank’s thinking in terms of policy changes.

What were market experts saying?

“I believe stocks are being helped by a halo from the strong earnings season,” Kristina Hooper, Chief global market strategist at Invesco, told MarketWatch via email.

“However, I think the major catalyst for the stock market movement upward is relief that the U.S. and China are headed for another round of trade talks. Investors have shown again and again this year that they want to believe the tariff wars will subside rather than intensify, so be prepared for some downside volatility if they fail,” she said. “And I do believe they will fail,” Hooper cautioned.

“It turns out Turkey was a turkey of a trade. U.S. markets rallied as rumblings of China coming to the U.S. table to talk trade. Turkey managed to look bit better by the end of [last] week too. The economic data remains decent if only a bit below expectations and the S&P 500 is once again knocking on all-time highs,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management LLC, in a note. “The path of least resistance now is higher, but as we have seen, news flow is important.”

What stocks were in focus?

PepsiCo PEP, +0.42% slipped 0.1% and shares of SodaStream SODA, +0.18% jumped 9.4% after the soft drink and snack food giant said it would buy SodaStream at an 11% premium over Friday's closing p[rice.

Tyson TSN, +0.61% added 1.6% in the wake of the announcement of its deal with Keystone Foods.

Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.73% reversed earlier losses to rise 1%. JPMorgan had slashed its price target on the electric-car company, dropping it to $195 from $308, arguing it was unlikely the company would be taken private, as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk recently—and unexpectedly—tweeted that he was attempting to do.

Meanwhile, some of the company’s suppliers are reportedly starting to worry about the auto maker’s financial health after Model 3 production sapped its cash hoard, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Estée Lauder Cos. EL, +0.69% shares rose 3.4% after the cosmetic firm reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, as it also reported revenue that grew more than had been forecast.

Lannett Co. Inc. LCI, -3.60% plummeted 60% after it said its distribution agreement with Jerome Stevens Pharma wouldn’t be renewed. It also gave a fourth-quarter outlook that was below expectations.

U.S.-listed shares of Roche Holding AG RHHBY, +0.32% gained 1.4% after its Alecensa cancer drug was granted marketing authorization in China.

ConocoPhillips COP, +1.03% shares rose 1.1% after the energy company reached a $2 billion settlement with Venezuelan state-owned oil giant PdVSA on an arbitral tribunal convened under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.

Separately, several suppliers in interviews said Tesla has tried to stretch out payments or asked for significant cash back. And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.

Tesla has improved its on-time payments to production-related suppliers to about 95% from 90% last year, according to people familiar with the matter. For nonproduction suppliers, Tesla is paying on time about 80% of the time, the people said. “We’re not behind because we can’t pay them,” Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an interview Friday. “It is just because we’re arguing whether the parts are right.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-discounting-another-lehman-like-moment-could-trigger-the-next-epic-economic-crisis-2018-08-20,"The Wall Street Journal once described him as “perhaps the most powerful journalist in America.” President Trump, however, isn’t nearly as impressed, having called him a “political moron.” Oh, and “a total dope” and “a loser.”

With mixed reviews like that, it’s no wonder George Will’s colorful prediction of a looming fiscal crisis stirred up plenty of buzz over the weekend.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, in a Washington Post piece that earned our call of the day, warns that, with the 10th anniversary of the Lehman Brothers meltdown just around the corner, “another epic economic collapse is coming.”

There’s also plenty of head-scratching material in there, as is often the case within Will’s body of work. Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal says his latest missive “is... not convincing.” Financial columnist Felix Salmon pointed in bewilderment to this one quote, in particular: “God, a wit has warned, is going to come down and pull civilization over for speeding.”

While perhaps obfuscated by Will’s flowery words, there’s really no mistaking his point: There’s a nasty stretch ahead for the stock market.

“The durable market rise that began March 6, 2009, is as intoxicating as the Lehman anniversary should be sobering: Nothing lasts,” Will wrote. “Those who see no Lehman-like episode on the horizon did not see the last one.”

He says that if we’re looking for some sort of event to mark the end of economic expansion, it’ll likely be when the annual budget deficit exceeds $1 trillion, and that’s expected to happen in fiscal 2019.

“Despite today’s shrill discord between the parties, the political class is more united by class interest than it is divided by ideology,” Will explained. “From left to right, this class has a permanent incentive to run enormous deficits — to charge, through taxation, current voters significantly less than the cost of the government goods and services they consume, and saddle future voters with the cost of servicing the resulting debt after the current crop of politicians has left the scene.”

So, how much stock does Trump put in Will’s forecasting skills?

No crisis so far this morning, with the market headed higher early.

The market

Stocks ended last week with a bang, and, for the most part, they are clinging to those gains. The Dow DJIA, -0.04% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% are slightly higher, while the Nasdaq COMP, +0.31% is off a bit. Gold GCU8, -0.37% and silver SIU8, -0.77% are showing bigger gains. Crude US:CLU8 is steady. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.21% is falling.

The same pretty much holds true overseas, as Europe SXXP, +0.05% is rising, while Asia markets ADOW, +0.38% closed mostly higher.

The buzz

PepsiCo PEP, +0.47% added some fizz to the day by announcing a $3.2 billion deal — $144 per share — for Israeli-based home-carbonation device maker SodaStream SODA, +0.18% Shares of SodaStream are jumping, while those of PepsiCo are tilting lower.

A Tesla TSLA, -0.87% competitor just filed for an IPO, hoping to raise money for an expansion that includes launching a smaller electric SUV to broaden its customer base. Shanghai-based Nio filed to offer up to $1.8 billion worth of American depositary shares, and if it succeeds, it would mark the fourth-largest U.S. IPO this year, behind Axa Equitable Holdings’ EQH, -0.88% at $3.16 billion.

Meanwhile, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund may invest more than $1 billion in Lucid Motors, another Tesla rival, according to Reuters. After an initial $500 million investment, the fund could eventually invest more than $1 billion and gain majority ownership of the Newark, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 2007 by former executives from Tesla and Oracle ORCL, +0.49%

Back then it was about “the new economy,” and now it appears to be tax euphoria driving optimism, according to the Topdown Charts blog’s Callum Thomas, who posted this chart to show how the S&P’s SPX, +0.12% longer-term earnings growth outlook hasn’t been this high since the later stage of the dot-com bubble.

“Indeed, it’s interesting to reflect on the history of this chart, it seems to speak more about sentiment than fundamentals (or maybe some mix of the two),” Thomas wrote. “With the U.S. economy still going strong, one may be tempted to channel Irving Fisher’s ‘permanently high plateau’ quote...”

The quote

“A modern Republican politicians are, with few exceptions, apparatchiks: they are creatures of a monolithic movement that doesn’t allow dissent but protects the loyal from risk.

That’s the message Ariana Huffington gave to the Tesla Inc. US:TSLA chief executive in a blog post Friday. Huffington, a “huge admirer” of Musk and author of the 2016 book, “The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time,” said his habit of overworking doesn’t help him or his company.

“Working 120-hour weeks doesn’t leverage your unique qualities, it wastes them. You can’t simply power through — that’s just not how our bodies and our brains work.” Ariana Huffington

“The science is clear. And what it tells us is that there’s simply no way you can make good decisions and achieve your world-changing ambitions while running on empty,” she wrote.

The human body needs to recharge, Huffington said, and Tesla would benefit if Musk took the time to “refuel, recharge and reconnect.”

“You’re demonstrating a wildly outdated, anti-scientific and horribly inefficient way of using human energy,” she said. “It’s like trying to launch us into our clean energy future (or into space) with a coal-fired steam engine. It just won’t work.”

The Times said Musk’s friends and Tesla’s board are concerned about his workload and the toll it’s taking on his health and well-being.

But in a tweet posted at 2:32 a.m. Sunday, Musk said he can’t afford to stop and catch a few Z’s. “Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not,” he said in a reply to Huffington.

Tesla shares tumbled Friday after the Times interview was published, and are now down almost 2% this year. The stock has lost more than 20% of its value since Musk tweeted earlier this month that he was thinking about taking the company private. That tweet also triggered an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",2018-08-19,Tesla
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/saudi-fund-may-invest-more-than-1-billion-in-tesla-rival-lucid-motors-report-2018-08-19,"Elon Musk is hoping an investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund can help take Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.80% private, but it may strike an investment deal with a Tesla rival, according to a report Sunday. The fund, called PIF, is in talks to invest in electric-car startup Lucid Motors Inc., according to Reuters. The report said after an initial $500 million investment, PIF could eventually invest more than $1 billion and gain majority ownership of the Newark, Calif.-based company. Lucid was founded in 2007 by former executives from Tesla and Oracle Corp., and has received significant funding from Chinese investors. While it had not built any cars yet, it hopes to start production later this year.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-short-sellers-are-up-12-billion-since-elon-musks-going-private-tweet-2018-08-17,"Investors betting that Tesla Inc. stock will fall appear to be having the last laugh, at least for now.

Tesla TSLA, -0.80% short sellers are up $1.2 billion in paper gains since the day Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted he was “considering” taking the company private at $420 and funding was “secured,” S3 Partners LLC, which tracks real-time short interest data, said in a note Friday.

Musk shocked markets with that tweet on Aug. 7, the first of many that day and which was followed by an email to employees explaining his reasons for wanting to take Tesla private. That day the shorts got walloped.

The tweet has sparked a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe and doubts have grown around the funding to cinch a going-private deal.

Tesla shares are off 20% since the $379.57 close on Aug. 7, including a 9% loss Friday on the heels of an interview on the New York Times in which Musk describes his “excruciating year” and blamed short sellers for much of his stress.

“Unfortunately for Elon Musk and the scores of Tesla retail and institutional long shareholders, the anticipated short squeeze resulting from Tesla’s march to $420/share never materialized,” S3 Partners LLC, which tracks real-time short interest data, said in a note Friday.

Tesla has about $11.2 billion in short-seller interest, behind only Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -0.51%

Short sellers bank on a stock falling in price. They then borrow the shares to sell them, hoping they can later pick them up at a lower price, return them to the original lender and pocket the difference.

There has been some short covering since the Aug. 7 tweet, but only about 4% of the Tesla short sellers have been driven away, S3 Partners said in the note.

“Shorts have only covered 1.3 million shares since Tesla’s original stock price spike, hardly a short squeeze and more likely an exit by shorter term momentum short sellers and fat-trimming by the lesser capitalized long-term short sellers,” the note said. “In actuality, many of the longer-term short sellers have backed up their bets and slightly increased their short exposure over the last week.”

Short sellers “are under no impetus to cover their positions” unless Musk can get more traction and the stock heads back toward the $420 mentioned, the note said.

“With ample stock available to borrow and stock costs easing slightly to below 2.50% fee levels, there is more than enough stock to short at a reasonable cost basis. If Tesla’s stock price continues to slide we may see additional shares shorted and total shorts reach the 40 million share levels we saw in May.”

In the Times interview, Musk said he had no regrets about saying “funding secured” in the tweet. According to the newspaper, efforts are under way to find a second-in-command who could take off some of the strain on Musk.

Tesla’s $305.50 close Friday was the stock’s lowest since Aug. 1. It brought weekly losses to more than 14%, the company’s worst five-day period since early February 2016. The stock is now off 1.9% for the year, versus gains of 6.6% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% and an advance of 3.8% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, -0.05%",2018-08-17,Tesla
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-will-lose-money-on-a-cheaper-model-3-analyst-says-2018-08-16,"Tesla Inc. is expected to lose about $6,000 on every cheaper, base-version Model 3 sedan it will sell because the electric car’s powertrain isn’t as cheap as expected, analysts at UBS said in a note Thursday.

The analysts based their assumptions on a teardown of a higher-end Model 3, costing $49,000, which included a more powerful battery option and a higher-end trim. Tesla’s profit on that pricier model is around $3,430 per car, they said.

See also: Elon Musk left plenty of questions about Tesla going private, experts say

A base version of the Model 3, costing the roughly $35,000 that Tesla US:TSLA has promised, would be unprofitable for the company to the tune of $5,900 per car, the analysts said.

Model 3s currently available to order start at $49,000 for a rear-wheel drive model, and quickly get pricier for “performance” sedans. On its web site, Tesla says a cheaper Model 3 with a “standard” battery will be available in five to eight months.

The ability to sell a vehicle that would appeal to the masses is the cornerstone of Tesla’s expansion plans, and the Model 3, which Tesla began making a year ago, is a high-stakes car that is critical to Tesla’s transition to higher-volume from niche car maker.

Tesla’s powertrain, although lauded by UBS’ engineering partners as an engineering feat that beat peers, was not as cheap as expected, the analysts said.

Its overall cost of $178 per kilowatt hour is only about 6% better than Tesla’s estimate of around $190 kWh for the models S and X provided two years ago and “well above Tesla’s guidance of below $100/kWh ending 2018,” the analysts wrote.

General Motors Co. US:GM Chevy Bolt’s powertrain clocked in at $205 per kilowatt hour and at $442 per kilowatt hour on a 2014 BMW i3, which would go down to $300-$320 in a newer BMW XE:BMW model, they said.

UBS said its teardown experts provided a “full breakdown” of the electric vehicles’ major components, including powertrain and battery, controlling electronics, and body and chassis, with each component removed and scrutinized.

The analysts reiterated their sell rating on Tesla and kept their $195 price target on the stock. Contrary to what the company has said, the analysts said they don’t see “sustainable profitability” for Tesla in the second half of the year, but given the higher-priced Model 3 in the company’s initial mix, a third-quarter profit “is possible” if Tesla can average production of more than 3,000 a week.

Tesla shares wavered between gains and losses Thursday, helped somewhat by a report saying that the company was on track for a steady Model 3 production and another report raising a price target on the stock.

The reports come as markets are still questioning Chief Executive Elon Musk’s going-private plan, mainly doubting that Tesla has the money necessary to pull off a deal and weighing the legal fallout of Musk’s taking to Twitter to announce that funding was “secured.”",2018-08-16,Tesla
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-elon-musk-describes-excruciating-year-says-worst-is-yet-to-come-2018-08-17,"Elon Musk said Thursday his tweet about having “funding secured” to take Tesla Inc. private was only intended to show transparency, and that despite the furor — and SEC investigation — it caused, he has no regrets about posting it.

In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times published Thursday night, Musk chronicled the events leading to that tweet, as well as this year, which he acknowledged has been exceedingly difficult.

“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career. It was excruciating.” Elon Musk, Tesla CEO

The Tesla chief executive described a constant state of exhaustion as the company has worked to ramp up production on Model 3 sedans, and said it was taking a toll on him.

“It’s not been great, actually,” Musk told the Times. “I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.”

The Times said Tesla’s board was concerned about Musk’s workload and health, especially his use of the sleep aid Ambien, and that efforts are underway to find a second-in-command who could take some of the strain off of him.

As for the now-notorious tweet, Musk said he was referring to a potential investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, although the fund has not actually committed to investing. He admitted to the Times that no one had seen or vetted it beforehand.

Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018

He told the Times he has no plans to stop tweeting, and has no regrets about that tweet in particular — “Why would I?” he said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the matter, and Musk could face charges if he was found to have intentionally misled investors.

He also addressed why he said the stock price for going private would be $420 a share — a reference that some at first thought was a joke, referring to marijuana. Musk said he wanted to price the stock at a 20% premium from its price at the time — which would have been $419 a share. So he rounded up. “It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,” he told the Times. “But I was not on weed, to be clear.”

Musk said he has recently been working 120-hour weeks, and sometimes would not leave the factory for days on end — including his 47th birthday in June. But while “production hell” appears to have peaked, Musk said his struggles are not over.

“The worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint,” he said. “But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”

Elon Musk’s plan to take Tesla private is a pipe dream

Elon Musk is a ‘natural maniac’ — here’s what it means for Tesla investors, in one chart",2018-08-17,Tesla
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ignore-trump-and-musk-heres-how-to-find-companies-whose-ceos-think-long-term-2018-08-18,"Whether you’re a fan of Tesla CEO Elon Musk or you think he’s just a nutjob, you owe him some gratitude as an investor.

That’s because he’s spotlighting an issue that regularly costs long-term investors a lot money: the tyranny of quarterly earnings reports.

The problem here is that quarterly reports enable investors and traders who like to impose their short-term thinking on CEOs to earn a quick buck — by pressuring CEOs to maximize near-term profits. This can hurt investors who are in it for the long haul.

Read: SEC studying frequency of corporate reporting after Trump tweet

Heaven forbid a CEO sacrifices near-term earnings to fund some cockamamie “visionary” plan that just might change an entire sector. The truth is, though, long-term thinking can be an investor’s best friend, as Warren Buffett loves to point out. The obsession with quarterly earnings reports gets in the way.

“They are really not good measures for a lot of public companies,” says Patrick McGurn, special counsel for Institutional Shareholder Services, which offers analysis that helps institutional investors make proxy voting decisions. “You want to look at what a company is going to do over the course of the cycle.”

Or longer, in the case of a pioneering entrepreneur like Musk. Musk now wants to take electric-car maker Tesla TSLA, -0.80% private, in part, to get away from the focus on quarterly results — and the obsession with inevitable short-term stumbles — by short-term thinkers.

But going private is a radical solution. It cuts off a company from market funding. And it will take Tesla shares out of the hands of Musk’s many true believers who now own the stock.

How autocratic leaders can help investors

Many companies take a more moderate approach to shutting down the short-term noise. They use dual share classes that concentrate voting power in the hands of a few people — often the founders. Or else founders own huge stakes, giving them enough voting clout to tune out the short-term thinkers.

Yes, these measures seem autocratic and undemocratic. So they are controversial. But they can actually pay off big time for investors.

Back in 2011-2012, for example, I suggested Amazon AMZN, +1.48% Facebook FB, -0.41% and Alphabet GOOGL, +0.94% in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, when they were out of favor, in part because each had ownership structures that shielded them from the threat of takeovers and interference by activists. But this gave founders the power to brush off investor concerns about a lack of near-term profits, and invest in strategic plans.

Those stocks have all been great outperformers since then — up fivefold or more. Amazon has advanced almost 10-fold.

Those worked out, but autocratic ownership isn’t always good. For every Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, there’s a management entrenched by a mechanism such as special share classes or devices that make it hard to change boards. Protected from the threat of takeover, bad managers can milk companies for extravagant pay or give juicy contracts to friends at the expense of shareholders, cautions McGurn, at Institutional Shareholder Services.

As an investor, how do you navigate this mess? What’s the best way to identify companies that have shielded themselves from short-term thinking, but don’t track the downside of entrenched management into your portfolio?

Here are the three solutions

1. Know your autocratic managers

When companies have dual share classes that give management concentrated voting power, don’t run away. Instead, hear them out so you can decide whether they have a long-term plan that makes sense. Listen to their earnings calls and study their filings.

You won’t always get it right. But good CEOs with concentrated voting power realize they have to explain what they are up to. And they spend a lot of time doing so. “They know they can’t just go to market and say ‘trust us,’ ” says Bryan Hinmon, portfolio manager of the Motley Fool Global Opportunities Fund FOOLX, +0.62%

Back in 2012 when Facebook, Amazon and Google were getting bashed for sacrificing near-term profits to fund long-term plans, CEOs and top managers were making a good case in earnings calls that their strategies made sense.

Around this time, Facebook’s Zuckerberg was trying to get mobile right because he knew it was the future for social media. He took a lot of heat, but he turned out to be right. Google was fine tuning Android and fiddling with self-driving cars. Android now helps Google better target ads. Autonomous vehicles seemed weird at the time, but they may be the next big trend in automobiles.

And back then, Bezos was building out server farms that eventually powered Amazon’s AWS cloud services, a key source of profits now.

“It is funny to think back that everybody was so upset with Bezos for not sticking with trying to be the world’s best online bookstore,” says Lamar Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund VILLX, -0.20%

Hinmon, at Motley Fool, cites Atlassian TEAM, +1.32% in messaging and collaboration software, and Watsco WSO, -0.55% in heating and air-conditioning equipment, as companies he owns where concentrated voting power helps managers pursue long-term strategies that benefit investors, even at the expense of short-term gains.

Here’s are a few shortcuts to help you identify the autocratic managers who are on your side because they think and invest long term.

• Favor founder-run companies because they often outperform. This makes sense. Founders are driven by the desire to build companies, as opposed to simply getting rich. Their passion for building does not go away once they make billions. So it’s easier to trust them than run-of-the-mill managers who never founded a company but have concentrated voting powers.

• Look for companies where top managers and founders own lots of the stock. As examples, Albert Meyer, portfolio manager at Bastiat Capital, cites Tencent TCEHY, -1.29% IPG IPGP, +0.31% Checkpoint Software Technologies CHKP, +0.44% Seaboard SEB, +0.00% Regeneron REGN, +2.29% and Amerco UHAL, +0.20%

• Be wary when top managers have special voting rights and proportionally less money in the stock, says McGurn, at ISS. This can happen, for example, when managers own special shares that give them 10 votes per share. When managers have little capital at risk but a lot of voting power, that can lead to mischief. Those managers have probably filled the board with cronies. So there could be poor board oversight.

2. Favor companies that suspend quarterly guidance

President Donald Trump wants companies to report earnings just twice a year. This is a bad idea. Moving to twice yearly reports like those used in a lot of foreign countries cuts down on news flow.

“As an investor, you ignore information at your own peril,” says Hinmon. “Having new information to update your thinking is critical.” Meyer, at Bastiat Capital, regularly buys shares of foreign companies but he says he feels less secure in companies that don’t provide quarterly updates.

A compromise here is for companies to eliminate quarterly guidance. You should favor companies that do this, because it gives managers more latitude to focus on the long term.

Berkshire’s BRK.B, -0.04% Buffett and J.P. Morgan JPM, -0.40% CEO Jamie Dimon recently called on CEOs to reduce “short-termism” by asking them to stop quarterly guidance. They said it often leads to “an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Companies frequently hold back on technology or research-and-development spending to meet guidance shortfalls caused by factors outside their control like bad weather, believes Buffett.

A 2006 McKinsey study concluded earnings guidance does nothing to help shareholders. But it distracts managers. Invest in companies that don’t mess with guidance, and you’ll know managers don’t have this distraction.

3. Favor companies whose CEOs are paid by stock returns

In 2010, I asked John Morgan, the CEO of a little company called Winmark WINA, +1.51% why he was buying so much of his company’s stock. He told me he didn’t get paid via stock options. So buying stock was how he wanted to get exposure to upside from his efforts to develop an equipment-leasing business at Winmark.

I liked that he was using his own money to align himself with shareholders. And he had spent a career in this business before launching it inside Winmark, a retailer at the time. So I suggested Winmark in my stock newsletter in June 2010. It traded at $29 then, and now it’s at $148, for 410% gains.

The key lesson here? When CEOs take little or no pay and they get a lot of their reward through stock exposure, it’s a good sign they are thinking long term.

A good example right now is Axon Enterprise AAXN, -0.61% (formerly Taser), says Villere, whose Villere Balanced Fund owns the stock. Earlier this year, founder and CEO Patrick Smith zeroed out his salary for 10 years. Instead, he’ll get rewarded via equity grants that vest in increments as Axon hits profitability and market-cap targets. The stock grants won’t fully vest unless Axon’s market cap rises 10-fold.

“Here’s a guy who is clearly playing the long game, and backing it up by his actions,” says Villere. As an example of Smith’s long-term thinking, Villere cites Smith’s decision to give away body cameras to customers including police. This sacrifices short-term profits. But it attracts long-term customers of Axon’s archiving, cloud and software services that support use of the body cameras.

Ironically, Smith’s no-salary plan is modeled after a similar one used by Musk at Tesla. In Musk’s plan, his option grants only pay out (big time) if Tesla hits aggressive market-cap and profitability milestones over 10 years. That’s a clear sign that Musk is thinking and investing in Tesla for the long haul, which will likely benefit long-term investors in Tesla’s stock.

Too bad they won’t get that payoff if Musk succeeds in taking the company private to shut down the noise from the short-term thinkers.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-is-on-track-for-steady-model-3-production-analyst-says-2018-08-16,"A report saying that Tesla Inc. is on track to make as many Model 3 sedans as the Silicon Valley car maker has promised gave the company’s shares a shot in the arm on Thursday.

Tesla TSLA, -0.86% shares turned positive in midday trading, and looked poised to snap a two-day losing streak that has taken weekly losses to more than 4%. The shares recently wavered between gains and losses but were off session lows.

Analysts at Evercore ISI wrote Thursday that they toured Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factory for two days and visited the Model 3 production line, and left “incrementally positive” on Tesla. Another report, from analysts at Bernstein raising their price target on the stock, also did its part in supporting the stock.

“Tesla seems well on the way to achieving a steady weekly production rate” of 5,000 to 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week, said the Evercore analysts, led by George Galliers.

“In addition, the capex required and constraints that need to be overcome to reach 7k to 8k units per week seem well within reach,” they said.

Evercore’s previous Model 3 production estimate of 123,000 sedans in the second half of the year could be “4% to 7% too low” after what they saw on the trip, the analysts wrote.

“While downtime and maintenance continue to place constraints on production, we did not see anything that would suggest Tesla is not able to produce 5k Model 3s per week today and at least 6k Model 3 a week very shortly,” they said.

The report was a welcome diversion from the worries centered on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s going-private plan and the questions swirling around the funding necessary for such a move and the legal questions around Musk’s tweet that announced the proposal.

Musk shocked markets Aug. 7 when he tweeted he was “considering” taking Tesla private at $420 a share, and that funding had been “secured.”

Regulators have launched a probe into the “funding secured” statement and Musk’s subsequent blog post detailing meetings with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund did little to squelch doubts about the potential going-private transaction.

In their report, Bernstein analysts led by Toni Sacconaghi increased their price target on Tesla stock to $325, representing downside of around 4%, from $265.

“On net, our fundamental valuation analysis suggests that Tesla is fully valued at current levels. In practice, however, we believe that the firmly entrenched bull and bear camps are unlikely to capitulate until either Tesla is taken private,” they said.

The analysts assigned a likelihood of less than 50% that Tesla will indeed go private.

Should a deal fail to materialize, there’s likely downside to about $300 a share, below the roughly $340 a share that Tesla was trading at before Musk’s first tweet.

Failure “could prompt investors to increasingly debate Elon’s credibility and seemingly unhealthy focus on the shares’ price and volatility,” the Bernstein analysts said.

A firmer take-private offer could result in upside to around $400 a share, they said, below the $420 that Musk mentioned “as we doubt investors will ever have 100% certainty on the deal closing until it actually happens.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-on-track-to-catch-their-breath-after-prior-days-strong-rally-2018-08-17,"U.S. stocks rallied for a second session Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at its highest since February as optimism that the U.S. and China will eventually resolve their trade standoff offset fears about Turkey’s currency crisis.

However, weak tech names, notably Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp., and Applied Materials Inc., limited the Nasdaq’s upside momentum.

How did the main benchmarks fare?

The Dow industrials DJIA, -0.04% gained steam as the session progressed to rise 110.59 points, or 0.4%, to 25,669.32, its highest close since Feb. 26. For the week, it rallied 1.4%. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% climbed 9.44 points, or 0.3%, to 2,850.13, rising 0.6% for the week.

The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.31% added 9.81 points, or 0.1%, to 7,816.33 for a weekly drop of 0.3%. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX, -0.16% a popular index that tracks semiconductor manufacturers, fell 0.8% on weakness in quarterly results from chip makers Nvidia NVDA, +0.76% and Applied Materials AMAT, -1.08% Analysts have also noted that tech companies have the most exposure to foreign sales.

On Thursday, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.31% all rose with the blue-chip index logging its best day since April.

What drove the market?

Investors continue to monitor the latest developments on the trade front. On Thursday, there was cause for optimism as the U.S. and China prepared to resume trade talks next week. Officials from both countries are also working on a road map to reach some sort of a deal that will lead to a summit between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in November, The Wall Street Journal reported.

But Turkey remained a concern with the Turkish currency down more than 4% against the U.S. dollar USDTRY, +2.3959% with the buck buying 6.053 lira, compared with 5.8246 lira late Thursday in New York.

While geopolitical issues surrounding trade and Turkey will likely remain short-term market drivers, investors are also monitoring the final batch of second-quarter results, which are expected to neutralize some of the headwind from abroad.

What were strategists saying?

“Dealers will be paying close attention to the trade talks between the U.S. and China, as well as the political wrangling with Turkey. U.S. stocks are holding up relatively well, but if global sentiment sours, the impressive strength of the Dow Jones and S&P 500 could be chipped away at,” said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.

Which stocks were in focus?

Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.86% shares slumped 8.9% after Chief Executive Elon Musk told the New York Times the past year had been “excruciating” and “the most difficult and painful” of his career.

Nvidia and Applied Materials both reported earnings late Thursday. A decline in cryptocurrency-mining sales weighed on Nvidia, sending shares down 4.9%, while a weaker-than-expected guidance pushed Applied Materials shares down by 7.7%.

Nordstrom Inc. JWN, -2.78% soared 13% after the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook.

Farm-equipment maker Deere & Co. DE, +0.05% fell after issuing a downbeat growth outlook but since has recovered to rise 2.4%.

DSW Inc. DSW, -0.43% shares sank 4.9% after the stock was downgraded to negative from neutral at Susquehanna Financial Group due to higher costs and margin pressure.

Which economic data were in the spotlight?

The University of Michigan said its consumer-sentiment index in August fell to 95.3, down from 97.9 in July, the lowest level in 11 months. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a reading of 98.5.

Meanwhile, U.S. leading economic indicators jumped 0.6% in July.

What did other markets do?

European stocks were mixed and Asian markets all rose except China’s Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.31% which closed down 1.3%, ending the week down 4.5% and marking the lowest close in nearly two years.

Oil futures US:CLU8 were higher while gold GCZ8, -0.34% settled mostly unchanged and the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.01% fell 0.5%.

https://www.thestreet.com/markets/rates-bonds/tesla-bonds-coming-back-after-musk-says-no-deal-14694531,"When it comes to Tesla (TSLA) and a controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk, the company's 5.3% bonds due in 2025 are always a thing to watch.

The bonds came back a tad on Monday after Musk announced on Friday what many anticipated -- that there would be no take-private transaction for the money-losing electric-car company.

When speculation raged that Tesla could indeed go private, there was some thought that such a move would include heavy debt financing, which Moody's Investor Service said would have been credit negative. But it later turned out Musk was talking about a deal with the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund, which would have included no debt.

Tesla's 5.3% bonds are usually a goof barometer of the market's assessment of the firm's long-term creditworthiness. The company's strategy to raise debt to fund new operations hinges on its ability to grow revenues. But with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, a CEO who told The New York Times he's been on Ambien and rising competition from other electric vehicle makers, Tesla bonds aren't exactly skyrocketing.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/27/2018/long-elon-musk-running-tesla-stock-has-come-down,"As Long as Elon Musk Is Running Tesla, the Stock Has to Come Down

Elon Musk moving past notions of privatization presents an interesting situation for Tesla (TSLA) . Personally, I think the incident as a whole displayed the incompetence of Musk, and removes any confidence I had in his ability to run the business. Barring psychology, I think we're looking at a big pullback in the stock in the coming months. The company might succeed in making its cars, but the cash burn relative to valuation simply doesn't add up. I think this company is one of the biggest examples of overvaluation that is plaguing the marketplace.

The fact that privatization was discussed shows me that Musk isn't competent on the managerial level. He might be an innovator that pushes industries, but he has displayed an inability, or lack of interest, in the financial side. Consider the logic. He takes a non--profitable enterprise public to raise a bunch of cash in order to finance bigger operations. He uses the money, sells the Tesla idea to drive a huge stock price valuation, grows a huge market capital position, and fails to use it. Then, after the company is extremely overvalued relative to its lack of profits, he proposes buying it back at a huge premium in order to take it private again? It makes zero sense. I think there's a lack of realism in Musk that needs to go if this company wants to become a profitable business.

I think Wall Street is as much to blame as Tesla is. Investors created a mythical ideology around Tesla and Musk that simply wasn't real. In a way, shareholders promoted the bubble of the stock because everyone was making money in the process. Wall Street never cares about the truth as long as share prices are rising. Now, when faced with the prospect of needing some actual earnings per share (remember those?), the criticism begins.

Tesla has succeeded in driving sales and consumer interest. But they're losing $700 million a quarter. Diluted shares continue growing. Total diluted shares outstanding increased by 5 million or roughly 2.8% year over year in the second quarter. The cash burn keeps running as the Model 3 production now goes into full swing (way behind schedule I might add), and I can only expect Tesla will spend more cash as the company faces the effects of high level production. Of course all of this has already been discussed. Every facet of Tesla has been analyzed by almost every person with a brokerage account. I won't debate the merits of the business model. What I will debate is the stock price. I feel that as long as Elon Musk as at the helm, the stock has to come down.

With the revenue growth that the company has created, the company could have profited a long time ago. Musk refuses to slow down. He immediately pushes into new things and expects his salesmanship on the market to finance it. That makes for a good story, but it doesn't do much for investors. Now, with a lot of convertible debt coming into play in February, I think Musk is feeling pressure to keep that stock price up. The company has convertible notes of $920 million coming due in February of next year. They don't exactly want to have to pay up on that debt at a time when cash is the key discussion. For Musk, he needs the stock price to be over $3.59 in order for that debt to be converted into stock. This sort of explains his overreaction to shorts and critics. Musk can't raise cash through stock financing right now, because he doesn't want to drive the stock down. If he does, he has to use his proceeds to pay $920 million. I honestly half suspect that privatization talks were an attempt to drive up enthusiasm and get this stock back up.

I'd bet this company will do just about anything to try to produce a profit in the second half, because they need market enthusiasm if they want that stock price holding $360 in February. It's a messy situation.

This is just the opening shot. Tesla has nearly $10 billion in long term debt. How can they service the debt, while also financing their operations? The answer should be from meaningful profitability. But we haven't seen that. One way or another, I don't see a scenario where Tesla doesn't need to raise money. They'll either need to take out debt in order to pay off debt, or they'll need profits to get the stock above $360. Or they'll have to say forget it, issue $3 billion worth of stock, pay that $920 million in debt, and use the rest to finance their business. The profitability option doesn't seem likely. If they do start making money, it'll be a show in order to assuage markets. It certainly won't be enough money to cover their obligations. The other two options either dilute shareholder value, or create more liabilities on the balance sheet.

The company needs a new CEO that knows how to produce cars. Until then, I remain bearish on this stock. There's simply childish behavior coming from the executive level, and it isn't sustainable. Ploys like privatization at $420 a share are ridiculous. Who would pay $70 billion in market capital for a company that does $12 billion a year in sales? He either used it to gain positive attention, or genuinely wants to get out of the public eye because of what's coming. I have no sympathy. This stock is absurdly valued, and there's huge downside potential.",,Tesla

Stay Out of Tesla

Warns RealMoney contributor, Stephen Guilfoyle.

Back on Aug. 7, Tesla (TSLA - Get Report) CEO Elon Musk commenced with his now-famous tweet storm. In a series of tweets, Musk indicated that he might be taking the firm private, that funding had been ""secured,"" and that all that was needed was a shareholder vote. Oh, and the market price of $420 per share was thrown around as well, which would have valued such a transaction at $70 billion.

A Securities and Exchange probe could lead anywhere. What the SEC in all probability wants to know is did Musk have a reasonable basis for his ""funding secured"" tweet, and his insinuated take-out price. On top of that, depending on what the SEC finds, there could be shareholder lawsuits in the offing.

Plainly, I know nothing. What does Jim Cramer tell you about firms going through anything related to ""accounting irregularities?"" He tells you to stay away. My thought is that the same strategy would apply when it comes to SEC probes. Who needs this headache? We have our own problems without creating more by getting involved in what is impossible to fully analyze.

Yikes. Sounds like Guilfoyle has some hot takes on why investors should, at the very least, be wary about putting money into Tesla right now.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/27/2018/focus-fundamentals-tesla,"Focus on the Fundamentals With Tesla

Wait! What? Tesla's (TSLA) go-private saga lurched to a halt late Friday night as both Elon Musk and Tesla's independent directors noted that the entrepreneur had decided to suspend his efforts to take Tesla private. So, the market firestorm that erupted with Musk's now-infamous ""funding secured"" tweet on August 7 has ended not with a bang, but with a whimper.

Those hoping for a $420 takeout price will be sorely disappointed, but given that the stock closed Friday at a 24% discount to that offer and that Tesla's 5.3% senior notes actually declined in price during the period of purported go-private discussions, this may have been much ado about nothing.

The harsh reality that Tesla shareholders now have to face is the sad one that I have spent more than half my adult life analyzing: Tesla makes cars, and car companies are not valued highly by the stock market.

At $420 Tesla would have been trading, by my calculations, at 25x 2019 EBITDA. At $320, Tesla is still being afforded 19x next year's EBITDA, and there is simply nothing in the automotive world that compares to that. The closest valuation comparable would be Ferrari, trading at about 15x 2019 EBITDA. Ferrari has gross margins well in excess of 50% and produces fabulous returns on the minuscule amount of capital required to turn out its cars and also lacks a cash-bleeding and debt-laden unrelated business unit, as Tesla has with SolarCity. In contrast Tesla has not produced a profit or positive operating cash flow for any annual period since its IPO in 2010. Management predictions of profitability in the third quarter of 2018 will remain just that, predictions, until early November when Tesla will likely report 3Q results.

Solvency will also continue to be a concern as Tesla has $920 million in convertible notes coming due on March 1, 2019. Any thought of an above-market takeover is effectively removed and Tesla will have to get its stock price to $360 by March by demonstrating positive cash flow and acceptable returns on invested capital.

So, that's the risk here for long-term, large institutional shareholders of Tesla. The valuation cannot be justified by normal financial analysis. Adding to the risk is Tesla's non-membership in the S&P 500. I know fund managers at most major asset management complexes and they all stay true to their benchmarks as much as possible, as their compensation depends on it. Based on the most recent numbers reported by NASDAQ, 57.4% of Tesla shares are held by institutions.

As of Friday's close, Tesla shares had declined 8.53% in the past 12 months versus a 20.03% one-year total return for the S&P 500-tracking ETF, SPY. If this record bull market has taught us anything, it is that stocks that are rising will continue to be bought by large funds, so for a fund manager to own Tesla he or she has to buck that trend.

So, if you are holding Tesla stock those are factors working against you. Of course, the prospect of a still-public Tesla will not likely diminish the intense media focus on the name. I will keep writing about Tesla and I am sure many others will, as well. In my experience with people who work at large institutions, however, day-to-day newsflow is not part of their firms' investment process. Focus on fundamentals and valuation, because the folks who run firms large enough to permanently impact the value of a $55 billion stock like Tesla most assuredly do.",,Tesla

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-bull-says-company-s-fundamentals-are-still-underappreciated-14694034,"Tesla Inc.'s (TSLA) wild ride continued Monday, Aug. 27, as the company's stock declined 2% in morning trading after CEO Elon Musk announced over the weekend the company was abandoning its consideration to go private.

However, longtime Tesla bull, Ben Kallo of Baird, said he sees a silver lining for the electric vehicle company.

Kallo believes that Tesla shares will be under pressure in the near-term, but that in the mid-term the company's still ""underappreciated"" fundamentals will lead the stock forward.

""We are buyers on weakness as we expect shares to move higher ahead of Q3 deliveries and results,"" the Baird note said. ""We believe progress on the Model 3 production ramp could be a significant positive catalyst for the stock.""

Kallo maintained the firm's ""outperform"" rating, which Baird has held since 2016. Baird currently has a price target of $411 on Tesla. That bullish view is based on the firm's belief that the ramp in the company's Model 3 production will eventually bring Tesla to profitability.

Tesla's stock has been on a downward slide since it was revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Musk's claims earlier this month that his company had funding secured to go private.

""I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,"" Musk said in a statement published by Telsa's official Twitter account Friday. ""Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was 'please don't do this.'",2018-08-27,Tesla
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-try-an-options-play-or-stay-away-14693827,"Back in my youth, there used to be such a thing as a three-ring circus.

Not the travelling variety that might appear in a mall parking lot near you, but the kind that you had to go to a hockey/basketball-sized arena to see. The main show would be centered in the middle of the floor.. in the ""center ring"" ... while on the outskirts, to keep people from being bored in between acts, there would be a continuous flow of smaller performances made by the likes of clowns, jugglers, and plate-spinners, etc.

These smaller shows were meant to distract.

Back on August 7, nearly three weeks ago, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk commenced with his now-famous tweet storm. In a series of tweets, Musk indicated that he might be taking the firm private, that funding had been ""secured,"" and that all that was now need was a shareholder vote. Oh and the market price of $420 per share was thrown around as well, which would have valued such a transaction at $70 billion.

No Deal

Speculators and short sellers who felt the squeeze ran the stock up on these tweets. The shares peaked at $387.46. Then, as the days progressed, the stock sold off just as hard as it had increased (bottoming at $288.20, before rising again early last week). What's the big deal about a $99 range over a short period of time anyway? Hmm.

In truth, the stock has flat-lined for a couple of days now, as investors were left in a state of great inertia provoked by the unknown. Expect that stability to end immediately.

What we now know is that Tesla will not be going private, at least not now. According to The Wall Street Journal, there did exist the potential for a deal last week that would have involved several deep-pocketed investors such as Volkswagen and Silver Lake Partners. The problem for Musk was allegedly that the investors would also wanted their share of say in the company. As the story goes, it was then that Musk pulled the plug. The story of how Tesla got to this point, however, is quite complex.

The Bottom Line

For me, what is clear is to avoid this name completely if one is already flat. Now, the focus for investors will turn in three directions.

Production Levels

These have long been the market focus, if only this were the only issue facing the firm.

Profitability

Perhaps the worst thing that could happen to Tesla would be turning in a positive quarter. At that point, the firm might be valued more like regular public corporations -- or heaven forbid, a normal automobile manufacturer, facing all of the margin pressures of that industry in general.

The SEC Probe

Can't forget about this. The Securities and Exchange probe could lead anywhere. What the SEC in all probability wants to know is did Elon Musk have a reasonable basis for his ""funding secured"" tweet, and his insinuated take-out price. On top of that, depending on what the SEC finds, there could be shareholder lawsuits in the offing.

The Markets Are Acting Rationally

Markets continue to climb to new records on typical slow summer trading volume. Overall, the action in the markets appears normal -- not similar to the late January melt-up (we all know what happened after). More sectors are participating and the VIX (volatility index) remains tame.

Tesla's Saga

Elon Musk said Friday he is keeping Tesla (TSLA) a public company, for now. Shares were hit in pre-market trading on Monday. Musk has lost a great deal of credibility during the take private saga, and it would be a good time to bring in a strong number two executive.

Data Dump

The Fed should respect the inflationary outlook more than it does currently.

Says my source at Nielsen:

""For the sixth consecutive week, soft drinks saw their highest average price per unit for the year. In fact, compared to this time last year, average unit prices this week have peaked for aluminum foil (+11%) and soft drinks (+5%)."" Back to school appears costlier year over year, too. ""Average unit prices this week are up 2% for office paper, 4% for pencils, 9% for pens and over 18% for highlighters.""

Sure, it's great to see one man lead the charge back into space, and Tesla Model Ss are now local drag strip legends. Jay Leno even looked like he had a blast on the Musk-created, second-generation Roadster on the latest episode of ""Jay Leno's Garage."" But the reality is that Musk's ridiculous, unraveled plan to go private has stripped him of the credibility that is essential to running a successful public company. That trust between a management team and shareholders is vital.

Not only that, the scrapped plan -- which was detailed in Musk's prime late-night hours on Friday -- has opened up Tesla to shareholder lawsuits and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation at a time when cash and executive attention spans are tapped.

""It has become clear to us that funding was not secured or there was not sufficient interest to take the company private at $420/share. And we think credibility has taken a hit,"" said frequent Musk critic Joseph Spak at RBC Capital Markets. ""We see potential ramifications from an SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits. Though these are admittedly unquantifiable, they would be an incremental call on cash for a company with a weak balance sheet.""

If you're obsessed with investing in the future of mobility, give General Motors (GM) a glance. The company has an experienced management team, an up-and-coming Uber-like service called Maven and a jewel in Cadillac that could be spun off within five years to extract value.

And above all else, GM doesn't have Elon Musk -- and that may be just fine and dandy.

Data Dump

What this market is doing right now is impressive, even if it's on anemic volume. It doesn't feel similar to the late January melt-up -- strong volume as euphoria gripped the minds of investors -- but rather a steady climb spurred by a solid U.S. economy and profit outlook. Continued dovishness by the Federal Reserve in the face of 4% GDP growth is helpful to sentiment as well.

The strength of the rally could be seen outside of the Dow Transports that TheStreet has written about. Joining the S&P 500 in record-high territory are the consumer discretionary, healthcare and information technology sectors, pointed out Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Researsh. The breadth of the S&P 600 sectors stands out quite a bit -- new record highs include consumer discretionary, consumer staples, financials, healthcare, industrials, information technology, telecome services and utilities. Rally on.

But maybe the Fed should be on the prowl for shock inflation.

Fear No Evil

As equity markets rallied on Friday morning, a couple of items struck me. It was almost as clear as if I could hear a ringing bell. The marketplace does not care, at least for now, about the state of chaos in Washington. We had already sort of figured that out as last week wore on. I get that. We have two examples to go off of in my lifetime where a sitting president came under the kind of political pressure that we potentially could currently see.

Markets did well in the late 1990s when President Clinton faced impeachment, and not so hot in the early 1970s when President Nixon was on the hot seat. In each case, market performance seemed more in line with economic performance, and not at all in line with what the politically astute might have expected. Now, the mid-terms... that's a horse of a different color.

So what does matter? My thought on this is that dollar strength certainly matters. There are days that the flattening yield curve certainly does matter, and other days where it seems not to. It certainly does seem to matter at least as far as sector rotation is concerned. The banks were broadly flat on Friday, while the S&P 500 was picking up about five-eighths of one percentage point.

Both currency valuations, and the steepness of the yield curve are driven by the level of aggression or lack thereof of both monetary and fiscal policy. We already know that Treasury needs to maintain an elevated level of borrowing, and has also indicated a new intention to focus on the long end of the curve. Very wise. Monetary policy? This is where Jerome Powell's speech on Friday comes in.

Markets are still pricing in a 96% probability of a September 26 rate hike. Write that one in stone, gang. Powell, in his own way, sounded a little more dovish in that Jackson Hole appearance than maybe some folks had expected. Yes, he made sure that we understand that he thinks the ""economy is strong."" Keep in mind that several key subordinates had expressed opinion over the last week or so that the Fed should not allow the spread between the yields of the two-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury bond to invert. This is the counsel that the chair is getting, at least from some corners.

Powell added on Friday ""We have seen no clear sign of an acceleration above 2% [presumably regarding consumer level inflation], and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating."" Whoa. Does that mean that a December hike (still 66% priced in) is a definite maybe?

Don't forget though, that the current round of trade negotiations are likely to result in a positive announcement regarding Mexico early this week, that the next tranche of tariffs aimed at China ($200 billion) is in the comment period, and will be through next week. The Federal Reserve must work its way around not only domestic uncertainty, but the unknown outcome of a trade war that is still more a war of words than facts.

Think of this. With Turkey and the exposure of several European banks to the Turkish Lira already circling the drain, not to mention the well-publicized fiscal deficit Italy now faces, Powell must judge just how likely it is that the European Central Bank (ECB) actually moves toward policy normalization as planned. Dovish signals from that corner will put the U.S. dollar on a pedestal, which hawkish Fed policy would only exacerbate. This actually makes the comments supposedly made by President Trump on July 30 to Italy's Prime Minister Guissepe Conte quite understandable if you remember the president's preference for a weaker dollar. Let that sink in. It's potentially important.

Where Does This Leave Me?

From a strategic vantage point, quite honestly, I am glad that I have stayed quite decisively net long the U.S. equity market. Let's think about economic strength. The housing market is stalling. New Home Sales are at an eight-month low. Existing Home Sales are as weak as they have been in two and a half years.

They say it's a supply issue. I'll tell you right now that I think the problem is threefold. First and foremost, this is a pricing issue. The average Joe or Jane no longer sees the dream of home ownership as such a bargain in the era of wage moderation. Then there's the double whammy of a central bank well into a rate-raising cycle coupled with crushing real estate taxes -- particularly in blue states that, under the new tax laws, are no longer as subsidized by the federal government as they once were. Folks won't really feel this until April. For many, this is still a personal uncertainty.

However, it's those very same tax laws that have afforded the average American consumer a substantial increase in disposable income, even without a substantial increase in wages. Savings levels are up too, by the way. Those tax cuts, coupled with a deregulated environment, have also unleashed animal spirits in corporate America. This has allowed for margin expansion, as businesses meet this increased demand. Are valuations high? Not really, when understanding the environment provided.

Listen, the future is still unknown, and are these economic conditions sustainable? Very hard to say. The solution for the investor/trader is to stay rooted in the moment. Investors should live by a code of disciplined rules that include preparation for that rainy day, because it will come. For now, however, corporate performance is strong and expected to remain so throughout the rest of the year. For me, a balanced, yet biased approach based on my expectations seems appropriate. The level of bias in this approach must be in accordance with the investor's tolerance for risk. No way around that, but you have to think. No intellectual laziness permitted.

Jugglers and Plate-Spinners

Back in my youth, there used to be such a thing as a three-ring circus. Not the travelling variety that might appear in a mall parking lot near you, but the kind that you had to go to a hockey/basketball-sized arena to see. The main show would be centered in the middle of the floor.. in the ""center ring"" ... while on the outskirts, to keep people from being bored in between acts, there would be a continuous flow of smaller performances made by the likes of clowns, jugglers, and plate-spinners, etc. These smaller shows were meant to distract.

Back on August 7, nearly three weeks ago, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk commenced with his now-famous tweet storm. In a series of tweets, Musk indicated that he might be taking the firm private, that funding had been ""secured,"" and that all that was now need was a shareholder vote. Oh and the market price of $420 per share was thrown around as well, which would have valued such a transaction at $70 billion.

Speculators and short sellers who felt the squeeze ran the stock up on these tweets. The shares peaked at $387.46. Then, as the days progressed, the stock sold off just as hard as it had increased (bottoming at $288.20, before rising again early last week). What's the big deal about a $99 range over a short period of time anyway? Hmm.

In truth, the stock has flat-lined for a couple of days now, as investors were left in a state of great inertia provoked by the unknown. Expect that stability to end immediately. What we now know is that Tesla will not be going private, at least not now. According to the Wall Street Journal, there did exist the potential for a deal last week that would have involved several deep-pocketed investors such as Volkswagen and Silver Lake Partners. The problem for Musk was allegedly that the investors would also wanted their share of say in the company. As the story goes, it was then that Musk pulled the plug. The story of how Tesla got to this point, however, is quite complex.

The Bottom Line

For me, what is clear is to avoid this name completely if one is already flat. Now, the focus for investors will turn in three directions.

1) Production Levels. These have long been the market focus, if only this were the only issue facing the firm.

2) Profitability. Perhaps the worst thing that could happen to Tesla would be turning in a positive quarter. At that point, the firm might be valued more like regular public corporations -- or heaven forbid, a normal automobile manufacturer, facing all of the margin pressures of that industry in general.

3)The SEC probe. Can't forget about this. The Securities and Exchange probe could lead anywhere. What the SEC in all probability wants to know is did Elon Musk have a reasonable basis for his ""funding secured"" tweet, and his insinuated take-out price. On top of that, depending on what the SEC finds, there could be shareholder lawsuits in the offing.

Plainly, I know nothing. What does Jim Cramer tell you about firms going through anything related to ""accounting irregularities?"" He tells you to stay away. My thought is that the same strategy would apply when it comes to SEC probes. Who needs this headache? We have our own problems without creating more by getting involved in what is impossible to fully analyze.

For those willing to gamble on direction, this is one of the few cases where purchasing options is a bit smarter than selling them. Depending of the speed and size of any move in the last sale of these shares, getting short options on either side of the market could leave the investor having to eat something truly awful.

2. -- Tesla Slumps After Saying It Won't Be Going Private

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares fell 3.4% in premarket trading on Monday after the electric vehicle company led by CEO Elon Musk said Friday it wouldn't be going private. ""Over the past several weeks, we put in place a process led by a Special Committee of the Board to evaluate a proposal Elon was considering to take Tesla private. Yesterday, we held a Board meeting, during which Elon reported on the work he and his advisors have been doing in connection with this effort,"" said a post on the company's website. ""Elon communicated to the Board that after having done this work and considered all factors, he believes the better path is to no longer pursue a transaction for taking Tesla private. After discussing this, we dissolved the Special Committee. The Board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla's operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward."" Musk wrote: ""I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable."" Musk sent Twitter ablaze on Aug. 7 by tweeting that funding for a deal to take Tesla private at $420 had been secured. Tesla closed Friday at $322.82.

3. -- U.S. and Mexico Close In on NAFTA Deal

The U.S. and Mexico were poised to reach a NAFTA deal - perhaps as soon as Monday - after five weeks of talks. The deal would create an opening for Canada to rejoin the discussions.

Significant breakthroughs between Mexico and the U.S. came during the past several days on automobiles and energy, Bloomberg reported, citing three people familiar with the process.

The two countries have been going back and forth because Donald Trump had threatened to withdraw from the 24-year-old trade pact unless it was reworked. Canada had stepped out of the negotiations, reportedly until Mexico and the U.S. agreed on new auto-trade rules.

The North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect under President Clinton in 1994. The agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico was initially created to help lower costs of trade and bolster North American trade.

Tesla (TSLA) shares were indicated sharply lower again Monday in pre-market trading after founder and CEO Elon Musk said late Friday that he was abandoning plans to take his company private following consultations with major investors.

Musk said the majority of his investors felt that the prospect of taking the company private wasn't a feasible option, owing to internal requirements within some fund that limit the amount they can invest in non-public companies and the difficulty the some private investors would have in converting their listed shares into ownership of a private corporation.

The U-turn marks the end of a 20-day saga for the Palo Alto, Calf.-based carmaker that has both ignited serious concerns over the ability of Musk to lead a listed company on his own as well as a reported investigation by the SEC over the nature of his communications on Twitter and whether they have violated U.S. securities regulations.

""I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,"" Musk said in a statement published by Telsa's official Twitter account Friday. ""Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was ""please don't do this.""

Tesla shares were seen 4.62% lower in pre-market trading, indicating an opening bell price of $307.90, a move that would lop around 19.3% from the carmaker's shares since Musk Tweeted his infamous ""taking Tesla private"" message on August 7.

""Moving forward, we will continue to focus on what matters most: building products that people love and that make a difference to the shared future of life on Earth"", Musk wrote. ""We've shown that we can make great sustainable energy products, and we now need to show that we can be sustainably profitable.""

Market Snapshot

Global stocks traded firmer Monday, with shares in Asia hitting a multi-week high and Europe posting solid gains in holiday-thinned dealing, as investors reacted to a dovish outlook on U.S. rate increases last week from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that clipped gains for the dollar and eased pressure on emerging markets.

Powell's speech to the annual symposium of central bankers and finance ministers in Jackson Hole, Wy. last week, alongside a view from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard that rate hikes be paused as the impact from Republican-led tax cuts fades into the early part of next year, allowed the U.S. dollar index to slip from a near one-year high to around 95.13 against a basket of six global currencies Monday, as investors moved cash out of the greenback.

""The economy is strong. Inflation is near our 2 percent objective, and most people who want a job are finding one,"" Powell said. ""If the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.""

Early indications from U.S. equity futures suggest the potential for another record-setting session on Wall Street, with contracts tied to the S&P 500 indicating a 8.4 point advance for the broadest measure of American stocks at the opening bell, following on from the all-time peak recorded Friday, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average looked for a 75 point bump at the start of trading for the 30-stock average.

European stocks got off to a solid start, as well, thanks in part to a stronger-than-expected reading of German business morale from the closely-watched Ifo Institute's business sentiment index, which rose for the first time this year in August to 108.3, with the Institute's president, Clemens Fuest, citing a ""truce in the trade conflict with the U.S."" which he said ""contributed to improved business confidence"".

The Board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla's operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward.""

Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets -- who was attacked by Musk on the first quarter earnings call -- served up a good take on the situation via a note on Sunday:

""Bulls will likely be happy because they can participate in potential value creation. However, to us the bears have more ammo on the near-term sentiment move. It has become clear to us that funding was not secured or there was not sufficient interest to take the company private at $420/share. And we think credibility has taken a hit. Recall, Elon initially stated ""investor support is confirmed"" but now shareholder sentiment is ""please don't do this."" The letter also indicated that institutional shareholders explained they have limits on private investments and there is no proven path for retail investors to remain in a private Tesla (which Elon wanted) - two ideas many sussed out quickly. This reinforces the idea that this whole episode was not planned or fully thought out and thus could get added to the list of debatable statements from the company over the years. Further, we see potential ramifications from an SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits. Though these are admittedly unquantifiable, they would be an incremental call on cash for a company with a weak balance sheet.""

Final Round of Retail Earnings

Best Buy Co. (BBY) will announce on Tuesday, Aug. 28 before the bell. FactSet estimates that the company will report earnings of 83 cents a share.

Elon communicated to the Board that after having done this work and considered all factors, he believes the better path is to no longer pursue a transaction for taking Tesla private. After discussing this, we dissolved the Special Committee. The Board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla's operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward.""

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/24/2018/why-saudi-aramcos-once-sizzling-ipo-put-ice,"Why Saudi Aramco's Once Sizzling IPO Is Put on Ice

The much-speculated IPO of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco is not happening for now, or ever, depending on whom you ask.

The IPO prompted a lot of discussion since it was announced in January 2016.

The main topic of conversation was the valuation, initially valued at $2 trillion by the Saudis. But there was plenty else to talk about, including minority rights for the 5% of Aramco that would be offered to which stock exchange(s) Aramco would be listed on.

It is now clear that in any scenario IPO will be delayed. To understand the delay in the IPO you need to understand first why it was planned, the three main challenges it faced, and the solution that is being deployed.

Aramco's planned IPO had both a short-term goal and a long-term goal. The short-term goal was to raise funds for Saudi's sovereign wealth fund PIF, famous for its $45 billion commitment to Softbank's Vision Fund as well as multi-billion-dollar investments in Uber and more recently in Tesla.

With a proposed valuation of $2 trillion for Aramco the 5% sale would raise $100 billion for Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabi (PIF). This number is important as I will return to it later. The longer-term goal for Aramco's IPO was to diversify away from oil. The 5% sale at the IPO would be the first step as Saudi would continue to sell shares in Aramco and invest globally into a diversified portfolio.

Whether the short-term goal makes sense depends on how PIF planned to use the funds. The long-term goal is clearly in the best interest of Saudi and its economy.

Now that the goals are clear, I'll outline the three challenges it faced from the onset. The first of these challenges quite simply is that whoever controls Aramco today has great influence over the economy of Saudi Arabia.

The Kingdom is the world's largest exporter of oil, and petroleum sector represents about 42% of GDP, which is around $680 billion. When investors talk about minority rights of the 5% of Aramco that was for sale, they are not only asking for influence over Aramco, but for influence over the economy. Squaring that circle is a big challenge.

The second challenge was convincing global stock markets and investors that the Saudi government was a good equity partner, and that the minority rights and certain corporate governance principles could be waived. The challenge here is that there is no historical public example of having the Saudi government as a majority shareholder for global investors to evaluate having them as a partner. This made waiving rights and corporate governance principles untenable and triggered a severe investor backlash against stock markets

The third and final challenge was not broadcast internationally and had to do with domestic population. For decades the staple of the Saudi economy has been oil and oil-related industries. It is scary for many to make such a big change, not least because change is in itself something that people resist.

But there are two added factors. The first factor I discussed above and that is the introduction of foreign investors as influencers in the economy. The second is the trust in PIF to be able to deploy these funds productively.

Oil is a commodity, and it has intrinsic value. Uber and Tesla Inc (TSLA) have no intrinsic value, they are simply bets on companies with massive negative cashflows. Sure, they might, by some miracle, become cash flow positive, but would you be willing to be your economy on that?

Softbank's Vision Fund is a businessman backed by an investment banking team all trying to be private equity fund managers, for the first time. Again, are you willing to bet the economy on that?

So we come back to the original question, why was the Aramco IPO postponed?

Not simply because there were challenges, the decision makers in Saudi don't give up. They came up with an elegant solution.

Aramco would borrow $70 billion from the markets for the first time, and use it to buy the shares held by PIF of Sabic, a Saudi global diversified chemicals company. This ticks several boxes. The first is that PIF gets its funding. Not the whole $100 billion, but $70 billion ain't bad. The second benefit is that by issuing bonds Aramco takes some initial steps towards an IPO by providing transparency, allowing investors to get to know how the Saudis manage Aramco while at the same time giving the investors the protection they need: a bond is senior to equity and has a fixed life. The final benefit is to allow the Saudi's to build up a track record with their SWF that would ease the minds of both global investors and citizens alike.

Current stories denigrate Saudi for not achieving an ambitious goal. The primary goal was never to IPO Aramco. The primary goal was to fund PIF and the Saudis found a solution that works.",,

1. -- Stocks Rise Ahead of Powell's Speech at Jackson Hole

U.S. stock futures traded higher on Friday, Aug. 24, ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's address at the annual conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and despite trade talks between the U.S. and China ending without progress.

Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 77 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 6.76 points, and Nasdaq futures rose 20.75 points.

The dollar slipped and Treasuries steadied as investors will look Friday to Powell's comments on the Fed's rate-hike forecast, and to see whether Powell responds to recent criticism from Donald Trump.

Trump told Reuters earlier this week that he was ""not thrilled"" with the Fed's rate increases under Powell, his own appointee, and that he should be ""given some help"" by the central bank as he threatens China with a trade war that has weighed on stock-market sentiment.

Powell's speech at Jackson Hole is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.

The economic calendar in the U.S. on Friday also includes Durable Goods Orders for July at 8:30 a.m.

Foot Locker Inc. (FL) reported fiscal earnings and sales for its fiscal second quarter that topped analysts' expectations. Same-store sales of 0.5%, however, came in below forecasts that called for an increase of 0.7%. The stock rose 0.8% in premarket trading.

2. -- Microsoft Is Being Probed Over Deals in Hungary - Report

The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into how Microsoft sold software such as Word and Excel to middleman firms in Hungary that then sold those products to government agencies there in 2013 and 2014, according to the people.

Microsoft sold some of its products to these intermediaries at steep discounts, and then these firms sold the products to the Hungarian government at closer to full price, the people told the Journal. Investigators are probing whether the middleman companies used the difference to pay bribes and kickbacks to government officials, the people said. Microsoft said it moved quickly to investigate itself after it became aware of ""potential wrongdoing"" at its Hungarian operations in 2014, according to a statement to the Journal from David Howard, the software giant's deputy general counsel. Microsoft said it's cooperating with the Justice Department and SEC. Microsoft is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells MSFT?

Facebook Inc. (FB) named Antonio Lucio as chief marketing officer, succeeding Gary Briggs, who announced his retirement in January.

Lucio joins Facebook from HP Inc. (HPQ) , where he led the marketing team for three years. His appointment is effective Sept. 4.

Speaking of HP, the printer and computer maker fell 3% in premarket trading on Friday after its fiscal third-quarter results topped Wall Street estimates but earnings guidance disappointed.

The company raised its forecast for full-year adjusted profit to between $2 and $2.03 a share, up from previous guidance of $1.97 to $2.02 a share. Analysts expect full-year profit of $2 a share.

Shares of Gap Inc. (GPS) tumbled 7.5% in premarket trading on Friday after the retailer posted second-quarter earnings and sales above analysts' forecasts but same-store sales at its namesake brand fell 5%.

Gap earned 76 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter, 5 cents higher than estimates, as sales rose 8% to $4.1 billion.

Comparable-store sales at Old Navy rose 5%, and gained 2% at Banana Republic. Same-store sales for Gap stores fell 5% compared with a decline of 1% a year earlier.

5. -- Tesla Model 3 Teardown Finds Quality Issues

UBS tore apart a Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Model 3 from November 2017 and found a host of quality issues.

""The engineers performed a fit & finish quality audit looking at 1,500-2,000 gap measurements in the vehicle in order to come up with an overall quality score. The Model 3 scored 2,390 which is in the below average range. In addition, the team independently rated the noise within the vehicle, finding the body/wind noise as ""borderline acceptable.""

""Neither score is impressive for a car that is priced at $49,000,"" said UBS analyst Colin Langan.

While UBS acknowledged the test car was an early model and Tesla has since tried to address some issues, it came away thinking that fixing Model 3 build quality won't happen easily.

""In our experts' opinions, the manufacturing issues around gaps and noise are much larger structural issues and do not lend themselves to being fixed quickly,"" said Langan. ""Their view is that many of the issues have to do with the basics of stamping out frame parts or the attachment thereof, which requires extensive retooling investment and shutdown time to fix.""",2018-08-24,Tesla

Top 7 Model 3 Build Issues Via UBS

Inconsistent gaps and flushness throughout the vehicle. Missing bolts in certain parts of the vehicle (ex. driver side fender). Usage of zip ties likely as a result of failed manufacturing processes. Usage of multiple different bolts on the same system, driving potential assembly issues. Loose tolerances on overall assembly (ex. glass rattles when doors are closed). Excessive force required to close doors/trunks. Lack of manual rear door handle.

A Tesla spokesman had this to say about the report via an email to TheStreet:

""Our customer satisfaction scores for Model 3 quality have averaged about 90% since January, with steady improvement through the year, even as the number of cars delivered has rapidly multiplied. Tesla customers never have to worry because if they are unhappy with their car when they receive it, they can either give it back for a full refund, allow us to address any issues, or ask for an entirely new Tesla.

As of April 2018, the standard deviation of all gaps and offsets across the entire car had already improved by nearly 40% on average, with particular gap improvements visible in the area of the trunk, rear lamps and rear quarter panel. Today, Model 3 panel gaps are competitive with Audi, BMW, and Mercedes models, but in the spirit of relentless improvement, we are working to make them even tighter. Our goal is to produce a perfect car for every customer.""

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/nvidia-is-still-surging-toward-autonomous-driving-success-14690750,"Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the first companies to present at the Autonomous Vehicle 2018 conference in Novi, MI.

The discussion reaffirmed why one of the autonomous-driving leaders remains atop the leaderboard.

The innovative tech company has been in the news lately, too. Whether that's the more recently announced Turing GPU architecture, the keynote presentation from CEO Jensen Huang in Cologne, Germany or the quarterly earnings results Nvidia released on Aug. 16.

While the quarter had some bumps around cryptocurrency, the rest of the results were very, very strong. Datacenter, gaming and automotive all displayed impressive traction and aren't showing many signs of slowing down.

Specifically looking at automotive, revenue grew 13% to a quarterly record $161 million. The segment grew 11% sequentially and registered the first double-digit growth rate in three quarters. Perhaps more exciting, though, is the fact that Nvidia began shipping its DRIVE Pegasus platform, the same platform that Daimler (DDAIF) and Bosch chose to build their auton`omous taxi service on.

Pegasus will enable level 4 and level 5 autonomous driving capabilities. The fact that it's now shipping brings autonomous driving and mobility-as-a-service platforms that much closer to being reality.

Nvidia's Autonomous Driving Plans

Another Nvidia product that should safely accelerate the realization of autonomous driving? DRIVE Constellation, a colossal project that will allow developers to test their programs in virtual worlds. Put simply, Constellation will allow for synthetic testing environments.

What does that mean?

Like most things in life, testing for autonomous driving is about quality over quantity. It doesn't do much good to test a system on a straight and empty passage over and over again. Conversely, testing in a more realistic environment can yield concrete improvements in autonomous capabilities.

While more realistic testing environments are preferred, it comes at a cost: Time and safety. Put simply, it takes a lot of time to log miles in the real world. While doing so, it puts drivers at risk of a potential accident.

In the virtual world, though, learning time is greatly accelerated, thanks to scalability, while safety isn't a concern because real drivers are not at risk. This may cause some to wonder whether virtual testing is a sufficient solution to perfecting autonomous driving.

Real-world testing is still necessary and synthetic testing isn't a one-stop shop to success. But it will play an enormous role in accelerating the technology and doing so in a safer manner.

Nvidia's senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro

During his presentation at AV18, Danny Shapiro, the senior director of automotive for Nvidia, gave a glimpse at what Constellation can do. Want to see how your driverless software operates during those few minutes a day where the glare from the sun is right in the car's sensors?

Instead of driving a few cars in that scenario each day and hoping for optimal conditions, a developer can test that specific scenario thousands of times over and over -- and do so 24/7. With Constellation, the user can manipulate the angle of the sun, add obstacles such as people or cars, alter the weather and go from day to night. There are a near endless amount of scenarios a team of developers can come up with to test their software.

But what completes the process is how Constellation is tied into Pegasus, Nvidia's onboard solution for autonomous driving.

While one server is running all of these scenarios on Constellation, another server is ""seeing"" all of these situations as it runs the autonomous driving hardware on Pegasus. In other words, the software running on Pegasus thinks all the scenarios it's encountering are real and it's reacting in that manner.

That allows developers to tweak and alter the system when it performs the incorrect function, and reward it when it performs the correct action. While not perfect, this system greatly expedites the process and keeps drivers safe.

There's a reason why a company like Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Waymo can drive 10,000 test miles in a day in the real world and 10 million test miles a day in a virtual environment.

Although Waymo doesn't use Constellation, it's clear how much there is to gain from various companies and mobility-as-a-service providers using it. Given that Nvidia is working with more than 370 automotive partners (not all of which will use Constellation), it's also clear that there will be interested parties when it is widely available. One possibility? Mercedes. The company already uses Nvidia to power its impressive MBUX A.I.-powered infotainment system, and as we mentioned earlier, will use DRIVE Pegasus to power its autonomous fleet offering. Based on its current relationship, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think it could be a perfect candidate for using Constellation.

Of course, all of these tests result in a massive amount of data -- something that most companies are not prepared for at the moment, Shapiro said. But Nvidia is offering solution after solution to help in this quickly budding industry.

The screenshot also goes against what Musk said to The New York Times in an interview on Friday, where he claimed that he didn't smoke weed and that the price of $420 that was in the infamous tweet was not due to marijuana, but simply a 20% increase to the current share price.

""It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,"" he said in the New York Times interview. ""But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned.' You just sit there like a stone on weed.""

The tweet, which has prompted a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, was an attempt at transparency, Musk told the newspaper, adding that no one reviewed it before it was posted.

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-short-burn-go-private-short-sellers-14689607,"Tesla's go-private drama hasn't resulted in the epic short burn that CEO Elon Musk may have hoped for, at least not yet.

In May, Musk warned that the ""short burn of the century"" was imminent on his Twitter account -- but if taking Tesla (TSLA) private was the burn he had in mind, it may have had the opposite effect for many short sellers.

Since Musk's now-infamous 'funding secured' tweet on August 7, which said that Musk was considering taking the company private at $420 per share, shares have tumbled more than 18% around questions on how Musk plans to deliver a multi-billion dollar go-private deal. The SEC has also opened an investigation into the claims and the seemingly haphazard way in which they were revealed.

Ihor Dusasiwsky of S3 Partners, which tracks the moves of Tesla short-sellers, told TheStreet on Tuesday that while some trimming has taken place, Musk was only able to banish 3.35% of short stakes. ""On [August] 6th (the day before The Tweet), shares shorted [were] 34.37 million and as of [Monday's] close, we were down to 33.51 million shares shorted,"" he wrote in an email.

""While shares shorted declined after the 7th, the change was gradual and not an overall 'short squeeze', but a cleansing of the smaller short-term momentum shorts and a re-allocation by the larger longer term value shorts,"" Dusasiwsky wrote. ""[On Monday] we saw a slight increase in shares shorted, up just over 200,000 for the day."" On Monday, Tesla shares rose just over 1%.

In the weeks since the ""funding secured"" tweet, reports have steadily trickled out on how Tesla is faring, and how Musk plans to execute on a deal that could require tens of billions of dollars. One came from Musk himself, who conducted a raw, emotional interview with the NYTimes last week that didn't appear to instill much confidence, with the stock dropping more than 4% immediately following the story.

More bad news included a big price target slash from JP Morgan, from $308 down to $195, another price cut from a longtime Tesla bull and a report that the Saudi Arabia Foreign Wealth Fund, PIF, is weighing a $1 billion investment in a Tesla rival, Lucid. Musk had written previously on Tesla's blog that the Saudi Fund was interested in leading Tesla's go-private deal.

On Tuesday, shares of Tesla were rebounding more than 4% to $321.52, as news that Morgan Stanley dropped coverage of the stock led to speculation that the bank was serious about working with Tesla on a go-private deal.

Dusasiwsky added that taking into account Tuesday's rebound, ""shorts are up $735 million in mark-to-market profits since The Tweet.""

Meanwhile, for some of the most ardent short-sellers of Tesla, such as Mark Spiegel, the uncertainty of the last few weeks served to confirm long-held criticisms of the carmaker: ""I see two outcomes: Someone gives Tesla a very ugly deal for $2 to $3 billion that lets them keep the lights on for another six months, or they could declare bankruptcy, re-org and get a real CEO in there,"" he told The Street in an interview last week.",2018-08-21,Tesla
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/is-tesla-s-chart-showing-a-buying-opportunity--14689302,"The Tesla Inc. (TSLA) trade is on this week.

Shares of Tesla were up more than 5% Tuesday morning, surging for a second straight session. The big driver today is go-private speculation on news that Morgan Stanley has discontinued rating Tesla shares.

Analyst Adam Jonas has been one of the loudest pro-Tesla voices on Wall Street in recent years. Now, MS has pulled its rating on the company.

Investors are speculating that the surprise move could signal that Morgan Stanley is getting involved in advising Tesla in its going-private deal in some capacity.

From a technical standpoint, though, Tesla's bounce higher this week isn't completely surprising; despite all the noise from bulls and bears this summer, this stock remains extremely technically obedient.

Here's what Tesla's price action looks like in the context of its recent uptrend:

Since selling off back in early April, Tesla's price setup has evolved into a well-defined (if wide-ranging) uptrending channel. So far, the last four tests of trendline support have provided attractive buying opportunities. We're seeing the fourth support bounce play out this week.

As an aside, it's also worth mentioning that many Tesla-watchers have talked about how shares have traded relative to the stock's 200-day and 50-day moving averages -- those two levels have had zero technical relevance for the last year. Traders can completely ignore them in 2018.

Tesla's recent rebound continues to jibe with its longer-term price trajectory:

This weekly chart of Tesla's price action since mid 2013 shows that shares have actually been in a very well-defined uptrend over the long-run, and that trend continues to be in play today. April's support bounce looks very similar to the similar bounces Tesla made back in February 2016 and November 2016; Tesla is up around 130% from its lows that year.

That's not to say that Tesla is without risk here.

Headline risk remains extremely high for shares of Tesla, as the company remains at the top of the news cycle. Between short-sellers remaining entrenched in shares (27.6% of Tesla's float remains short here) and Musk and company vying to take the company private, the odds of a positive or negative surprise moving the stock materially remain very high.

But, for investors who already want to build a position in Tesla, we're staring down one of the most attractive buying opportunities in 2018.",2018-08-21,Morgan Stanley
https://www.thestreet.com/technology/meet-renovo-the-amazon-web-services-of-autonomous-driving-14688901,"The autonomous driving space is in a very exciting place right now.

Not just because of the eventual convenience of having our cars drive us to work (or pick us up from the bar), or from the life-saving improvement in safety we might see, but the industry is incredibly exciting because of all of the innovations that are constantly bubbling up.

Daydreaming about watching Netflix (NFLX) while we sit in our cars is cool. But seeing all the new companies, ideas and concepts evolve and the speed at which this evolution is happening is quite intriguing.

One such company is Renovo. Speaking with CEO Chris Heiser, he described his company as the platform that autonomous application companies build on -- ""think of us like AWS,"" from Amazon (AMZN) , he said, referring to Amazon Web Services, which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments on a paid subscription basis.

""Building web services is challenging -- just writing the software -- but then there's the whole question of how to scale it, how do you make it reliable, all these sorts of things. So we solved that problem,"" Heiser explained.

What many casual autonomous vehicles (AV) observers don't realize is how many different applications can be involved in an self-driving car. Something that seems as simple as a high definition (HD) map is actually a complex product involving huge amounts of data.

There are artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactions happening both inside and outside the car and an entire ecosystem of opportunity.

That can range from media content to asking the passenger whether they'd like to place their favorite order with Starbucks (SBUX) or Domino's (DPZ) as a location comes within a certain distance.

There are dozens of sensors, cameras, radar, lidar -- all sorts of devices to analyze everything from driving distance between two cars to whether the driver is nodding off and falling asleep.

The bottom line: there are dozens if not hundreds of considerations for the future of autonomous driving. And while Renovo is not solving each one of its own, it's making a platform in which solving those problems is more efficient and achievable.

""This is exactly the way you build web services, the way you build big data centers, it's basically the way all modern software works today -- except for automotive,"" he said. ""So we're changing that; we're bringing a true platform approach to building these next generation automotive systems.""

Autonomous Driving Today

Branching out more broadly, Heiser spoke about the autonomous driving landscape in general. As far as mobility services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Waymo is the current leader, he says.

The company is currently testing its service in Phoenix and hopes to officially launch by year's end. Beyond that though, Waymo is gearing up for a larger rollout. The company's orders for up to approximately 82,000 Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Jaguar vehicles implies it has much bigger plans ahead.

Heiser estimates it will take roughly 5,000 to 10,000 AVs to roll out an autonomous taxi service per city. By that estimate, Waymo looks like it's attempting a 10 to 20 city rollout over the next few years. ""That sounds about right to me,"" Heiser said, adding that it would be a ""reasonable rollout.""

Waymo is the leader now, but that doesn't mean everyone else should give up and go home. Just because the company has a rollout in Phoenix doesn't mean it can easily migrate to Minneapolis or Detroit. Even Waymo CEO John Krafcik alluded to ""migration"" issues in previous discussions, pointing to geography, weather and other considerations as potential hurdles.

There's still room for plenty of other players in the robo-taxi space, be it General Motors (GM) with Cruise or the recent partnership between Bosch and Daimler (DDAIF) , which will use Nvidia's (NVDA) DRIVE Pegasus to power its autonomous fleet ambitions.

The analyst community predicts that mobility services will reach large valuations. Morgan Stanley recently put a $175 billion valuation on Waymo. RBC's numbers went even higher under some circumstances, while its long-term estimates for Cruise went above $40 billion. Keep in mind GM bought the company for a reported $1 billion (including incentives) in 2016.

Ultimately though, these companies are providing logistics services. Moving people is one scenario, but so is delivering goods and shipping products or supplies. Transportation is a $2.3 trillion market and that leaves plenty of room to support high-valuation companies that are creating highly disruptive technologies, Heiser noted.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/shorting-a-stock-14688016,"To many investors, stocks are a game. By studying, researching, and making the right tactical move at the right time, they believe they can win that game.

That doesn't always mean buying the right stock just before it increases in value. Say you're interested in a company to invest in, but your instinct is that it's going to decline soon. What is your move in this situation?

Certain investors will short-sell that company's stock. It's a move that some use to profit, while others use to try to minimize losses. Other investors, though, think shorting a stock is a bad idea, and something one should never do.

But what does it actually mean to short a stock, and what are the apparent advantages and disadvantages of doing it?

What Does it Mean to Short a Stock?

When an investor goes long on a stock, she buys it with the belief that it is going to increase in value over time. Going short, on the other hand, is what some investors do when they believe the stock is about to decrease and think they can take advantage of that. In short selling a stock, the investor doesn't actually own it.

Let's use an example to demonstrate it. Say you've been reading up on Company X, and you're certain the value is going to go down, and soon. A lot of investors who believe that simply won't touch the stock. A short-seller, though, will act.

Company X shares are currently worth $100 each. The short-seller may borrow 20 shares from their lender or broker, and then sell them. 100 x 20 = $2,000.

Perhaps X's shares fall down to $80. The short-seller buys back the shares and has made a profit. How much? Well, there were 20 shares, and each share declined $20. $20 x 20 shares = a net profit of $400.

That, of course, is the profit made if the short-sale goes how you assumed it would go. It doesn't always. This short-seller might have been wrong, and instead a big week for Company X leads the shares to increase to $110. Now afraid that the shares will continue to rise, the short-seller decides to purchase the shares back before he incurs any more losses. Now, instead of multiplying a profit of $20 by 20 shares, they're multiplying a loss of $10 increase in price by 20 shares they must repay. Their loss is $200.

Short-sellers also have to take margins into account. You don't own stocks when you're short-selling them, so the funds are put into a margin account. The account requires 150% of the short-sale's value to be in it at all times. Because the short sale was worth $2,000, a short-seller would have to put in an additional $1,000 as an initial margin requirement.

That margin will change depending on how the value changes. If the short-seller's instinct was right and the value begins to fall, the total margin requirement will be lower, and a short-seller will receive any additional money from the account.

If the short-seller was wrong and the share value goes up, though, the margin requirement will increase as well, and he will need to put more money into the account.

Why Do People Short-Sell Stocks?

Why do some investors decide to do this? It's clearly a high-risk situation for them, and even more out of their control than a usual investment. Is it worth it?

If they play their cards right, certainly. And what could be more tempting for an experienced investor than the ability to make money off of a company's decline instead of losing money from it? It's not something that would necessarily be part of an investor's overall strategy, but it's something in their back pocket if they're feeling particularly lucky.

Not that individual investors are usually the ones to short-sell stocks. Many short-sellers are hedge funds, trying to protect themselves during a bearish market or worse.

Short-selling is done at times, not just to possibly make a profit, but try to avoid any more disastrous losses. When the market is in a downturn, it can be difficult to find a stock you can profit from while buying. Short-selling a stock gives investors the option to make money in environments where it has become harder to do so.

It is also done to mitigate losses from a declining stock in your portfolio. Say you own shares in a stock that has gone from a value of $150 to $125. You see the writing on the wall and don't anticipate it going back up anytime soon. You could sell it to try to avoid deeper losses. Or, an investor looking to get a little money back could short-sell their shares, and -- if the value continues to decline -- buy them back and perhaps be able to pocket some money from the whole ordeal.

Risks of Short-Selling

There are rewards in short-selling if you get it right. But investors don't always get it right -- and enough of them trying to can have major consequences for an economy.

The pros of shorting a stock are all based on the idea that a short-seller's instinct that a stock is about to tank is a sound, logical one that will come true. Despite your best efforts, however, that isn't something that can ever be predicted with complete accuracy. A lot can happen. What if you short-sell a fledgling company that is suddenly bought out by a larger company and the shares rise? What if a company you view as overvalued doesn't come back down to earth as quickly as you thought it would? Your investment is not only at a loss, but your margin increases too.

If the short-sale has a good buy-stop order, you may be able to protect yourself from greater losses. But if you try to stick it out and the price still won't fall, then you'll be out quite a bit of money.

There's no limit to how much you could lose on an attempted short-sale. Waiting too long to stop a failed short-sale could devastate an investor financially, especially if they made too large an investment in it.

Another thing potential short-sellers need to be aware of: you aren't the only one trying to short a stock. If one investor noticed that a company's shares could decline in value, it's likely a lot of them did. A lot of short-sellers is not good for the market.

Notable Examples of Short-Selling

Some economists put part of the blame for the 2008 stock market crash and Great Recession on all the investors short-selling companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after the housing market collapsed.

At its worst, too much short-selling may have contributed to major economic problems.

In other instances, it can tell you how investors view a company.

One recent example of a company with a lot of short-sellers is Tesla. As backlash against Elon Musk's tweets about his most recent earnings call grew and he continued to respond to it through tweeting, short-sellers increased.

Musk, to absolutely no one's surprise, has attempted to mock the short-sellers, tweeting the joke, ""short shorts coming soon to Tesla merch,"" but the jokes haven't stopped short-sellers. And who could blame them? In the wake of his tweet about wanting to take Tesla private for $420, the shares have declined by 15%.",2018-08-21,
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/why-this-analyst-thinks-alibaba-stock-is-too-cheap-14687724,"Believe in the BABA hype or not.

Chinese e-commerce king Alibaba (BABA) is set to report its much-hyped earnings this Thursday. There are quite a few concerns around the trade war and poor Chinese economic data approaching the print.

That said, Wall Street's top analysts aren't ready to shy away from being bullish on Alibaba just yet. Here we use TipRanks data to take a closer look at what Wall Street's top analysts see in store for this volatile stock.

A Stellar Bull Case

""We think Alibaba is years ahead of any competitor in driving digital commerce forward,"" said MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson. He has a $280 price target on the stock, indicating massive upside potential of over 60%. ""Of greater consequence is Alibaba's foray into digitizing offline commerce (new retail), which we think is even further ahead and has potential to multiply Alibaba's addressable market,"" Sanderson added.

Alibaba is investing aggressively to gain a greater slice of the market share by hiring more delivery executives and also expanding its offline footprint. True, the company's investments have recently weighed on its numbers. Yet, analysts are not wary of the short-term pain if it translates into long-term gain.

As Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus states, ""We remain comfortable with the lower long-term margin profile as it will allow the company to generate a higher level of absolute profit over the long term and should lead to increased efficiencies across Alibaba's entire ecosystem.""

Looking ahead, the company is planning to expand its footprint to India, the world's sixth largest economy and second most populous country in the world. Alibaba already holds a stake in multiple upcoming Indian companies, including online wallet and payments company Paytm as well as online grocery company BigBasket. Additionally, there are talks of Alibaba partnering up with one of the Indian conglomerates to compete with the likes of Action Alerts PLUS holding Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) owned Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce company.

These discussions are relatively new and encouraging for investors eyeing Alibaba.

Moreover, the company has attractive projections.

Analysts expect an approximately 60% increase in top-line in the quarter that ended June compared with a 58% increase in the last quarter, despite tariff worries and currency woes. Coming to valuation, the company seems to be fairly valued, with immense upside potential especially considering the micro level factors and growth pipeline. Having a forward price to earnings ratio of 28.65 times compared with Amazon's 111.1 times, coupled with a nearly 20% fall from its recent high two months back, makes Alibaba a steal deal.

Bottom Line

Alibaba is portraying tremendous growth and momentum. Moreover, the stock seems to have born the brunt of overblown worries around U.S.-China trade worries, as investors ignored the company's micro-level financials. With double-digit growth in all its segments, the stock does not seem to become a loss-making machine anytime soon.

And at the same time, impressive gross merchandise volume growth coupled with massive smartphone and internet penetration in China is expected to act as major bull factors for the company. Coming to the market consensus, the stock floats a Strong Buy rating at the moment, with all 11 analysts polled in the last three months having a buy rating on the stock. We can also see that the price target currently stands at $250.55, indicating robust upside of over 45% from current levels.",2018-08-21,

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/trump-versus-the-federal-reserve-do-not-expect-15-percent-inflation-and-rising-rates-14688159,"Fun battle.

Donald Trump's latest verbal attack on the Federal Reserve -- designed no doubt to steal the narrative at Jackson Hole -- has me scouring my long off-the-record lunch two weeks ago at the New York Federal Reserve for insights.

While the instinct for investors is to mildly worry about Trump's repeated Fed attacks as sowing the seeds for inflation, and leading to President Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson appointing a new Fed chair in 2020 that raises rates to 10% to crush inflation, it's OK to relax a bit (for now). The Fed is fiercely independent and my sense is that members of the central bank rally around one another when being slammed by Trump.

So what does that mean?

Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to lead the market down the path of data dependency when it comes to rate hikes as those that held the spot before him did. If the economic data warrant more rate hikes, Powell will drive consensus and pull the trigger. If the economy says a pause is needed (likely the case later this year), Powell will drive consensus and chill out. It's almost that simple -- so simple that even the occupier of the White House could understand.

Said Fed expert and CEO of Quill Intelligence Danielle DiMartino Booth: ""Part of the frustration stems from a lack of appreciation going in that Jerome Powell was no Yellen clone. This is a man who once worked for a dollar salary to educate the Congress on the perils of the U.S. defaulting on its debts. His leadership style thus far shows he is more independent that any of his three predecessors and therefore less at risk of caving to political pressures. It's good news for the country long-term but does not necessarily fit a low-rate agenda in the here and now.""

Data Dump

Facebook's (FB) lukewarm second quarter -- and massive negative market reaction to it -- hasn't shaken the confidence of too many bullish hedgies. Nearly 100 hedge funds owned the social media giant's stock as a top 10 portfolio position at the start of the third quarter, according to new Goldman Sachs data. That positioning continues to earn Facebook the most popular stock among hedge funds, based on the top 10 largest hedge funds Goldman tracks.

Clearly the call has worked wonders: Hedge funds have lagged the broader market this year, returning a measly 1%. Enjoy that beach in Greece, folks.

Tesla (TSLA) shares surprisingly reversed course on Monday and traded higher into the close off an interesting story in The Wall Street Journal. While suppliers are worried about getting paid, according to the story, the big takeaway is that Tesla's cash is in an OK position compared to second quarter. The story projected Tesla's cash will end the third quarter higher than the second quarter amid the Model 3 production ramp.

Very important to hear that, and it's likely Tesla's stock will trade with an upward bias in the short-term pending a fresh Elon Musk bombshell.

But don't ignore the moves in the market for Tesla bonds, bulls. Pointed out my source at one of the bond rating agencies: ""Tesla 5.3% notes due 2025 tumbled roughly 1.5 points Monday to test new all-time lows below 88, after another week kicked off with a raft of confidence-shaking developments for the electric vehicle producer.""

A recent survey sent privately by ""a well-regarded automotive supplier association"" found that 18 of 22 respondents believe that Tesla is now a financial risk to their companies. The Journal also reported that several suppliers said that Tesla has asked for significant cash back and attempted to stretch out payments.

In spite of that, all of the respondents to the survey said they wanted to sustain or expand their business with Tesla, and none wanted to terminate their relationship with the electric vehicle maker.

The Journal's sources said that while Tesla has improved its on-time payments to production-related suppliers to about 95% this year from 90% last year, for nonproduction suppliers, the company is paying on time only about 80% of the time.

When asked for comment, Tesla referred to the comments CEO Elon Musk gave to the Journal during an interview Friday.

""We're not behind because we can't pay them. It is just because we're arguing whether the parts are right."" Musk told the Journal. ""We are definitely not going bankrupt.""

JPMorgan on Monday, Aug. 20, slashed Tesla's price target to $195 from $308, saying that it appeared ""funding has not been secured"" for CEO Elon Musk's proposal to take the electric vehicle maker private. The analysts initially had boosted Tesla's price target after a tweet from Musk on Aug. 7, said he was considering taking Tesla private.

The price slash came after a report over the weekend that Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, PIF -- Musk said he believed Saudi Arabia's PIF could provide the necessary funding -- was planning to sink $1 billion into Tesla competitor Lucid Motors Inc., a company that was started by an ex-Tesla board member.

Tesla shares were down slightly when the market closed.

Ever since Musk's tweet earlier this month, the CEO has had some up and down moments.

In a tweet on Sunday, Musk responded to Ariana Huffington, who had said in a blog post that Musk wasn't working effectively.

Musk responded, ""You think this is an option. It is not,"" adding that Ford Motor Co. (F) and Tesla were the only two American car companies to avoid bankruptcy.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) fell 0.7% after JPMorgan slashed its price target on the electric vehicle maker.

Wall Street Overview

Stocks closed higher on Monday, Aug. 20, as investors awaited trade talks between the U.S. and China later this week and a meeting of central bankers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 89 points, or 0.35%, to 25,759, the S&P 500 rose 0.24%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.06%. Dow component Nike Inc. (NKE) rose 3.1% after analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group upgraded shares of the athletic apparel maker to positive from neutral.

Investors this week will look to a speech from Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who will speak at the Jackson Hole Central Banking Symposium on Friday, Aug. 24. Powell reportedly will be discussing the economy and monetary policy when he gives his speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Meanwhile, a delegation led by China's vice commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, will conduct two days of talks in Washington starting on Wednesday.

JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cut his price target Monday on Tesla Inc. (TSLA) to $195 from $308, saying that it appeared ""funding has not been secured"" for CEO Elon Musk's proposal to take the electric vehicle maker private.

Musk said earlier this month he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 a share and added that funding was ""secured."" Last week, Musk said he believed Saudi Arabia's PIF could provide the necessary funding, although sources close to the sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect, according to Reuters.

A report from Reuters on Monday said PIF was in talks with Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc. about investing the company.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/pepsico-spends-billions-to-help-save-the-planet-and-sell-more-flavor-pods-14687121,"With cash, comes a new thought.

""SodaStream (SODA) is calling out PepsiCo (PEP) for its second tone-deaf marketing scheme of 2017. Clearly, the soda and bottled-water industry will stop at nothing to sell products -- even making light of harsh realities, fears and prejudices that citizens face every day. Now, in addition to polluting our oceans with plastic, they're using recent protests against police brutality to sell cans of soda? I say to Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi - you're better than this. You know it and the world knows it.""

That was SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum on April 5, 2017, in the wake of PepsiCo's horribly received Kendall Jenner TV ad. I guess time -- and a boatload of cold hard cash -- heals old wounds. PepsiCo said at 2 a.m. EST on Monday that it will pay $144 per Sodastream share, which represents an almost 11% premium to Friday's closing price, to gain control of the company's in-home soda technology. PepsiCo said the price represented a 32% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average.

Birnbaum will stay on and lead the company. Judging by an interview he did with the Financial Times, he is under the impression SodaStream largely will be left alone to operate as it sees fit. He likely is sorely mistaken -- big brother Pepsi will move quickly to introduce its brands and people to the SodaStream platform, market the hell out of the platform and create a host of on-the-go water bottles that may take aim at Clorox's (CLX) Brita system. PepsiCo has had interesting obsession with bottles in recent years.

First came a test of Gatorade pods that snap onto a specially designed water bottle in 2017. More recently, PepsiCo unveiled DrinkFinity -- another water bottle plus flavor pod contraption. The company pitches these efforts as trying to reduce plastic waste (and by extension, costs of doing business), similar to the message on the thinly worded press release about the SodaStream deal.

Whatever the case, PepsiCo is paying a pretty penny for SodaStream. Incoming new CEO Ramon Laguarta best move fast to max out synergies. Already, one widely followed beverage analyst is out panning the deal.





""That said, we can't help but see parallels to Coca-Cola's (KO) decision to acquire a stake in Green Mountain in 2014, and question whether this deal - which also brings together a large consumer packaged goods company and an in-home beverage maker - will do much to solve PepsiCo's ongoing struggle to improve volumes in its North American Beverage segment (which, despite sequentially improving in Q2, remain weak),"" says Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. ""In short, we remain concerned about challenges facing PepsiCo's core business - and, as such, continue to see limited upside for PepsiCo in the near-term.""

By the Numbers

I mentioned these numbers from Bank of America Merrill Lynch over the weekend. But they warrant repeating as the market prepares to start the week on a high note ahead of breaking the historical bull market record on Aug. 22.

The numbers: (1) 11 of 21 commodity markets have experienced ""bear"" markets (i.e. >20% peak-to-trough decline) this year and a further nine ""corrections"" (i.e. >10% peak-to-trough declines); (2) 12 of 45 MSCI country indices are in ""bear"" markets and a further 17 equity indices have seen ""corrections""; and (3) The S&P 500's summer surge has been clearly led by defensive sectors (top five performing U.S. sectors past three months include staples, utilities, REITs, healthcare, telecoms, in that order). Specifically on the oil front, the latest dive below $70 a barrel suggests China's economy is headed to a darker place later this year. That, of course, will have ramifications for U.S. companies.

Pointed out Bernstein's top oil analyst Neil Beveridge:

""Oil markets are increasingly nervous about the possibility of a slowdown in Chinese (and emerging markets more broadly) oil consumption given its role in driving global demand. China is clearly going through a period of de-leveraging and trade tensions with the U.S. are having a negative impact on business confidence and investment. If the A-share index is the leading indicator of the economy, then the signs look ominous.""

Morgan Stanley Expects Foot Locker to Beat on Earnings

Morgan Stanley seems to have conflicted feelings about Foot Locker Inc. (FL) ahead of its earnings release.

Analysts at the firm expect Foot Locker to report earnings of 72 cents a share on Friday, August 24, slightly ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimate of 70 cents. However, the firm's expected same-store sales growth of 0.6% is lower than Wall Street's 0.8% expectation.

Morgan Stanley maintained its ""underweight"" rating and $44 price target, a 14% downside from the stock's opening price Monday.

""We remain confident in our long-term Underweight thesis, given our work that indicates NKE's DTC (direct to consumer) growth poses a significant threat to FL's top line,"" analyst Lauren Cassel wrote. ""NKE is increasingly focused on its direct-to-consumer strategy, particularly online, and our analysis suggests 46% of Nike.com SKUs are not available on FootLocker.com.""

Nike Inc. (NKE) has made no secret of its intentions to lean heavily on its direct-to-consumer business in the future as a way to grow revenue and Morgan Stanley believes that this will ""reduce the amount of 'unique' product sold into Foot Locker over time.""

Walmart Signs Deal With Anthem to Expand OTC Drug Access

Walmart (WMT) has partnered with health insurer Anthem (ANTM) to provide expanded availability to over the counter drugs to seniors.

Tesla Could Have $25,000 Vehicle in 3 Years, Musk Says

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares are falling more than 3% Monday as investors ignore CEO Elon Musk's latest claims about the company's future.

Musk told tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee that Tesla could build a $25,000 car in the next three years ""if we work really hard.""

Currently, Tesla's Model 3 is the cheapest offering at $35,000 and the company is pinning its hopes of mass market penetration on that vehicle.

However, Tesla is also currently under investigation by the SEC over tweets Musk sent two weeks ago about plans for the company to potentially go private.

PepsiCo to Purchase SodaStream for $3.2 Billion

Shares of SodaStream (SODA) are up 10.17% premarket Monday after consumer food brands company PepsiCo (PEP) announced plans to purchase the company for $3.2 billion.

Pepsi will pay $144 per share for the company, a 32% premium over the stock's 30-day trading average.

SodaStream allows customers to make carbonated beverages at home using refillable cylinders. It is sold in 80,000 individual retail stores in 45 countries with Germany, France, Canada and the U.S. being its biggest markets.

Tesla (TSLA) sold off pretty hard on Friday, giving up nearly 9%. I'm not going to lie to you, I gave serious thought to buying the name late in the day. In fact, trying to figure on where to buy this troubled name is what I spent too much of my time on as the day expired. It was not long ago that Tesla equity holders were all over social media taunting the shorts in the wild aftermath of CEO Elon Musk's now famous tweet-storm that made headlines a couple of weeks ago.

Being one who shorted the name that day (and the next), I know. Some of that hate came my way.

What the Musk-faithful do not understand is the trader only hunts. We are mercenary in nature. Just as likely to make a purchase as we are a sale. Only probabilities of risk/reward matter. Oh, do not get me wrong.... I do invest. Just not in Tesla.

By now, you've all read the horrific Elon Musk article published in the New York Times. Musk speaks of a constant state of exhaustion. His personal alarm seems multi-directional. Easy for us to dismiss. 120-hour work weeks. A 24-hour shift on his birthday. Things that we have all have to do at times, but that we also do complain about. Mental exhaustion is a very real thing. I can almost feel for Musk. Compassion, however, is not a reason to buy anything.

The versions of this vehicle currently available range in price from $49,000 to $80,000. The UBS report states that these more expensive versions do indeed make money, but at $35,000, the firm would lose $2,300 per sale. The UBS analyst who authored the note, Colin Langan, feels that Tesla may be headed for the firm's best quarter due to these factors, but that the condition is not sustainable.

Obviously, I covered that short too early. Made some lunch money, when it could have been a night (or several) on the town. Being flat, the question is now, where to, or do I get long? Maybe. The Feds are still looking at these guys.

More Bad News

News broke over the weekend that the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Elon Musk might have been looking to for help on taking his firm private is talking to Lucid Motors, a privately held manufacturer of electric vehicles. In other words, a Tesla rival. Lucid is not yet selling its vehicles. As far as one can tell, the firm has been accepting refundable deposits and expects to start building these vehicles later this year.

The possibility of the Saudi investment is just that, a possibility. Terms have been drawn up that reportedly could have the fund investing more than $1 billion in several increments. According to Yahoo Finance, the later increments would be reliant upon certain production goals being met. Does this mean that the fund is unable or unwilling to get more deeply involved with Tesla? That is impossible for us to know at this point.

Uber board member Arianna Huffington also blasted Musk on Twitter for not getting a lot of sleep. Watch her discuss why sleep is so important below with TheStreet.

Charting Tesla

One thing you need to know is that you don't need to do this. In fact, I often tell you when we discuss trading that I am in the foxhole next to you. With this one, just as a heads up, I may not be.

First, let's make this clear. I don't short naked options in either direction when it comes to highly priced, money losing firms that the SEC is watching, whose most attractive asset is a large short interest. Just too dangerous.

The Trade

However, as an instrument of speculation, meh. You never know. What I do know is that the trade would merely be for sport. I'm not risking the house, or even my next meal. The stock went out at $305.50. The pajama traders have knocked it down below the $300 level this morning.

The name is now a falling knife. The daily MACD went negative on Friday. Money Flow and Relative Strength will likely send negative signals once the shares open for trade. There are two levels for me to watch. The $298 level is key. That's a 61.8% retracement of the entire 2018 range. Support there would be a third consecutively higher low. Not exactly an ""ascending base"" for a number of reasons, but still something that could be taken as a technical positive. A crack of the $298 level would allow for the stock to approach the $284 level (The stock was hitting $294 as this article was being published). That would be a 100% retracement of the July through August ramp.

Like I said, nobody needs to do this. We took advantage of euphoria two weeks ago. Can we scrape a little something off of the bottom as well? I don't buy a share above $284, if I act at all. If the stock never gets there, I'll live. If it gets there too fast, I may just ""pop smoke"", and head for $250.

U.S. stocks markets are pointing to a positive start on Monday, Aug. 20, following their European and Asian counterparts higher, as investors await trade talks between the U.S. and China later this week and a meeting of central bankers.

The S&P 500 is expected to add 6 points, or 0.23%, when markets open and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.21%.

Investors this week will be looking to a meeting of central bankers at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole symposium for signs of their outlook on markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak on Friday. The Fed this week will also release its minutes from its July 31 to Aug. 1 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares dropped 5.77% in premarket trading, after reports that the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund, who CEO Elon Musk said could help him fund his take-private plan, was in talks about investing in rival Lucid Motors Inc. Reuters reported that the wealth fund, known as the PIF could incest more than $1 billion in Lucid and obtain majority ownership. Tesla shares lost 8.93% on Friday after Musk gave an afternoon with the New York Times, going into the details surrounding his now infamous Aug. 7 tweet and his punishing work schedule.

The company, however, posted fourth-quarter sales and profit that beat estimates due to higher sales of Estee Lauder makeup and Clinique and La Mer skincare.

Sodastream International Ltd. (SODA) shares were up 9.97% in premarket after PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) said it had entered an agreement to buy the Israel-based in-home soda maker in a $3.2 billion deal.

Firewood

With Turkish markets closed much of the week due to holiday and the official kick-off of the college football season not until this Saturday, the investing public will have to look elsewhere for focus. They won't have to search very far. If the fun and games of the Kansas City Fed's economic symposium at Jackson Hole are not enough to capture trader focus, the further development of the ""trade war"" with China certainly will.

Markets rejoiced last week as China' s Commerce Ministry officially reached out to accept the U.S. Treasury Department's long-standing invitation to restart trade talks. So, have we won a trade war? Not even close. Are we going to win a trade war? Perhaps, we just let the game play out.

For the Chinese economy, growth appears to slow. For the U.S., an economy far more self sufficient than most, a position as the consumer market of choice, as well as the lopsided balance of trade all seem to hand the U.S. side obvious leverage in these talks. Most of us were at some time taught that ""the customer is always right."" Still, the night grows colder. There is so much wood to cut.

The Drive

It was 1986. The AFC Championship Game. Cleveland Municipal Stadium. John Elway's Denver Broncos took possession of the ball at their own two yard line, down by seven with time running out. You know the rest. This Wednesday and Thursday, China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen will be in Washington, D.C. to meet with U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass and his team. So, the dance starts, with each side sending the ""B Team."" This overt attempt to get the ball rolling is really most likely an attempt to outline where and what is possible between the two.

The groundwork is being laid for Presidents Trump and Xi to meet twice in November, first at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and then at the G-20 summit in Argentina. That's all nice, but remember that uncut wood that I just mentioned?

This Thursday, while both sides talk in D.C., that well-publicized tranche of 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S. is set for implementation. China has already stated its intention to respond to this tranche dollar for dollar. The far more important next step of adding that same 25% tariff to another $200 billion worth of goods is still in its comment period. That comes to a halt on September 5. What are the odds that actions already set for this Thursday intensify not only the talks in D.C., but the action across financial markets? I'd say pretty good.

I have already mentioned that in the U.S.'s favor is the fact that this is the home of the desired market. In any normal relationship, it is the customer that holds the cards. What stands in the way of that normal condition here is the American proclivity to short-termism, and the ability for the Chinese to play a longer game. Though President Xi is effectively ""leader for life"" at this point, he is up against an October 15 GDP print that could cause a loss of face. Keep GDP on track, and the game moves back to China 2025, as that nation attempts to further entrench itself as a global powerhouse.

The U.S. side may feel pressure to show a victory of some sorts either ahead of, or going into the mid-term elections. This could lend itself, in my opinion, to something partial in nature, but quantifiable. The heavy lifting on items such as technology sharing and intellectual property theft might possibly be left to both side promising to talk again soon. You didn't think it would be this easy, did you?

The possibility of the Saudi investment is just that, a possibility. Terms have been drawn up that reportedly could have the fund investing more than $1 billion in several increments. According to Yahoo Finance, the later increments would be reliant upon certain production goals being met. Does this mean that the fund is unable or unwilling to get more deeply involved with Tesla? That is impossible for us to know at this point.

Chart Of The Day: Tesla

One thing you need to know is that you don't need to do this. In fact, I often tell you when we discuss trading that I am in the foxhole next to you. With this one, just as a heads up, I may not be.

First, let's make this clear. I don't short naked options in either direction when it comes to highly priced, money losing firms that the SEC is watching, whose most attractive asset is a large short interest. Just too dangerous.

However, as an instrument of speculation, meh. You never know. What I do know is that the trade would merely be for sport. I'm not risking the house, or even my next meal. The stock went out at $305.50. The pajama traders have knocked it down below the $300 level this morning.

The name is now a falling knife. The daily MACD went negative on Friday. Money Flow and Relative Strength will likely send negative signals once the shares open for trade. There are two levels for me to watch. The $298 level is key. That's a 61.8% retracement of the entire 2018 range. Support there would be a third consecutively higher low. Not exactly an ""ascending base"" for a number of reasons, but still something that could be taken as a technical positive. A crack of the $298 level would allow for the stock to approach the $284 level (The stock was hitting $294 as this article was being published). That would be a 100% retracement of the July through August ramp.

Like I said, nobody needs to do this. We took advantage of euphoria two weeks ago. Can we scrape a little something off of the bottom as well? I don't buy a share above $284, if I act at all. If the stock never gets there, I'll live. If it gets there too fast, I may just ""pop smoke"", and head for $250.

Keep one thing in mind, if it ain't fun, don't play.

""For Fisker, we would become a public company at one point in time because that is simply in my view the right way to do it to get access to the right financing,"" Fisker tells TheStreet. ""I can't speculate what other people think about their company, but for Fisker for sure in the near future we will look at becoming a public company.""

Since electric car maker Fisker is a private company, we don't know the company's financial state. But on the surface it has a good pitch to prospective investors. The company's high-end electric car called the Emotion is on track for a release sometime in 2019. Fisker is also looking to debut an electric car priced below $35,000 sometime in 2020, while also dabbling in autonomous shuttles.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-worst-time-to-be-buying-the-sp-500-is-right-now-says-this-trader-2018-08-29,"Walk, don’t run, to the next stock-market record. That looks to be the order of the day as the S&P 500 appears to have 2,900 in its sights, but only just.

Making it tough for the index, which tapped that big level on Tuesday for the first time ever, is the fact that a long holiday weekend is looming.

Plus we’re about to roll into September, which is bursting at the seams with potentially market-moving events — more trade deadlines, a potential U.S. government shutdown and another Fed meeting, for starters — that could keep investors nervous. Never mind that September historically has been a pretty tough month for stocks.

Read: As S&P 500 rises to a record, these laggards are expected to come roaring back

With that comes our call of the day, which cautions against investors dipping a toe in stocks right now. “If the best trade is buying weakness and selling strength, no matter how safe 2,900 feels, this is definitely the wrong time to be buying,” writes CrackedMarket blogger Jani Ziedins.

He says chasing prices higher is a bad idea because a big chunk of the upside for stocks has already been seen, and the risks of a “normal and healthy dip” rise with every point.

“In fact, if the best trade is buying weakness and selling strength, this is actually a darn good time to start thinking about locking-in profits. Remember, we only make money when we sell our winners and it is impossible to buy the next dip if we don’t have cash,” says Ziedins, who adds that he’s still upbeat on the medium-to-long term and looking for a rally into the year-end.

Here’s more measured advice from Jeremy Glaser, a senior director at Morningstar. Wall Street’s record run is no time to panic, he says, but “could be a good opportunity to double check that your portfolio is in good shape in case a downturn is in the cards.”

The market

The S&P SPX, +0.14% , Nasdaq COMP, +0.35% are trading higher at the start, while the Dow DJIA, -0.03% is off a bit. Gold GCU8, -0.37% is slipping and the dollar DXY, +0.00% is up, along with crude US:CLU8 Bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.20% has firmed up.

Plus: Gas prices are set to drop as summer driving season ends

Overseas, Europe SXXP, +0.06% is tilting lower (though Zara parent Inditex ITX, -7.18% is getting hammered), while Asia markets ADOW, +0.38% closed higher.

The chart

The performance gap between U.S. and eurozone stock markets keeps widening, with the U.S. doing better. But don’t get tempted onto the continent by thinking it’s a good deal, cautions a team of equity strategists led by Mislav Matejka at J.P. Morgan Cazenove, in a recent note.

Matejka reasons that the eurozone is still trading at an “outright premium” to the U.S. on a price/earnings metric, and some big-picture factors, such as the fuss over Italy’s budget, making the team cautious going forward. He backs that up with a couple of charts. The first lays out how sour it is gotten for eurozone stocks lately:

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-stock-soars-as-ship-to-store-tire-deal-with-amazon-expanded-nationwide-2018-08-28,"Shares of Sears Holdings Corp. soared Tuesday, after the struggling department store chain said it expanded its deal with Amazon.com Inc., to provide ship-to-store tire installation and balancing services for those who buy tires on e-commerce giant’s site at “hundreds” of additional stores.

The program, which kicked off in May at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas, is now available nationwide, including in Alaska and Hawaii. The ship-to-store option has been integrated into the checkout process for purchases of any brand of tires, including DieHard, on Amazon.

Sears stock SHLD, -2.80% ran up as much as 18% soon after the open, before paring some gains to close up 12.6%. Volume ballooned to 6.8 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 1.2 million shares.

The stock had closed at a record low of $1.10 as recently as Friday, in the wake of yet another announcement of store closures, amid increasing concerns of continued losses and declining sales. At that point, the stock had plunged 40% in August, and 69% this year. In comparison, the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -1.16% had rallied 14.9% year to date and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% had gained 7.5%.

Don’t miss: Yes, Sears is likely to collapse, but its biggest stakeholder will be just fine.

“The response from Amazon customers around this program has been extremely positive. Our competitive bundled price for tire installation, which includes the installation of the tire, wheel balancing, valve stem or tire pressure monitor rebuild kit and the tire disposal fee is resonating with these customers,” said Mike McCarthy, general manager of Sears Automotive. “We’re thrilled to extend this valuable service across even more areas and into hundreds of additional stores.”

When the launch of the program with Amazon AMZN, +1.50% was announced on May 9, Sears stock shot up 15.9% to close at $3.20. Since then, the stock has tumbled 61%.

Sears is likely to release fiscal second-quarter results later this week. There aren’t enough analysts who cover the company to provide a FactSet consensus for earnings per share, revenue or same-store sales. Sears has reported a quarterly loss for at least the past 20 quarters, according to FactSet.",2018-08-28,Amazon

Built by the company's IMDB subsidiary, the new offering will be for the estimated 48 million people who use the company's Fire TV streaming devices, according to the report.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/i-paid-my-boyfriends-rent-and-bills-to-improve-his-credit-score-then-he-bought-a-house-without-telling-me-2018-03-09,"Dear Moneyist,

I am a 47-year-old woman living in New Jersey. Currently, I own a duplex with a family member.

My boyfriend and I had been looking at houses for about six months. We finally found one we both liked. After the home inspection, it seemed to be out of reach with all repairs it needed. At this point, he wanted to take out the mortgage himself and put me on the deed, with the agreement that the money I got from the sale of my home would go into the new house. He also asked me take out a $20,000 loan to renovate my home to make more on the sale.

Since the original deal fell through, I decided not to look at more homes with him. He is extremely picky and the process was just too much. I told him to go with the realtor and, if he found a property he liked, then I would look.

Don’t miss: How to give your home to your children tax-free

Meantime, he is moving my household into a storage unit for easy moving.

The first time out without me he made an offer on the original house. He refused to show me paperwork and, when I asked him to call the lawyer to see what I needed to sign, he refused. He told me that he was only putting the house in his name and I would still be required to pay money from my sale into the house.

Also see: After my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money

As an aside, I had been paying all his bills on time so that he would have a better credit score for our future purchase, he paid a nominal amount of rent and I paid all his bills. Then he started texting me to buy this or that on Amazon, for him or his band.

I had him leave on our fourth anniversary as he told me about his plans to not include me and had not paid his bills for 3 months.

Do I have any recourse on the loan he insisted I take out for renovations? Is there anything I can do? I am unemployed. We had no contract regarding rent. I did not sign the contract for the home he is now buying. Or do I just suck it up and take it as a life lesson?

Jobless and Boyfriendless in New Jersey

Dear Jobless,

You got played.

But don’t blame yourself. He drew you in over time and convinced you that he wanted to build a future with you and, perhaps, for a time he did. You trusted him and you believe (or believed) in him. That’s a good trait. Of course, there were red flags: paying his bills and buying stuff on Amazon for his band, pushing you to renovate your home with a $20,000 loan. I trust you can cancel and/or repay it. I hope you didn’t give him any large sum of money for this new home.

Finance and romance will forever be intertwined. If you want to know whether someone is on the level, their financial life will give you a good clue. And Americans are skittish about such matters. Two-thirds of people in a relationship say they would consider breaking up with their partner if he/she had hidden a debt, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 people carried out by market research firm YouGov on behalf of life insurer Haven Life. Any lack of transparency is a bad sign.

Another study found that people found the same photograph of a person more attractive when they’re told that he/she is a saver rather than a spender, according to “A Penny Saved Is a Partner Earned: The Romantic Appeal of Savers.” People are blank canvasses. We are always at risk of projecting our hopes and dreams onto them, despite all evidence to the contrary. “Money is a complicated subject for couples and often becomes an issue of power and control,” says Fran Walfish, a psychotherapist in Beverly Hills, Calif.

It would be a very difficult case to pursue an ex-boyfriend for unpaid rent. This fellow’s fiancée wanted him to buy her a second home in her name only, in case they divorced. And this man’s wife left him after two days of marriage. You’re not the first person to be taken in by romance and charm, assuming he had any. And you certainly won’t be the last. Given that you could have ended up owning a home with this guy, staying right where you are sounds like a good outcome.

It’s a small price to pay.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/arlo-stock-falls-after-post-ipo-earnings-amazon-and-google-competition-questioned-2018-08-28,"Investors are feeling a bit insecure about home-security company Arlo Technologies Inc., following the company’s first earnings report since its IPO and the release of several initiation reports from Wall Street analysts that delved into competition with Amazon.com Inc. and Google.

Arlo ARLO, -4.50% a Netgear Inc. NTGR, -0.82% spinoff that makes home-security cameras and related products, reported a net loss per share of 29 cents on revenue of $111 million Monday afternoon in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Tuesday marked the end of a voluntary “quiet period” for sell-side analysts, and at least five initiated coverage of the company, with three buy ratings and two hold ratings, according to FactSet.

Shares were down 7.3% in Tuesday trading, recently changing hands at $21.39, 34% above the IPO price of $16. The average price target of four analysts who provided them Tuesday morning, all of them from banks listed as underwriters on Arlo’s IPO, was $29.

Guggenheim Securities analyst Robert Cihra, who started coverage with a neutral rating and $26 target, wrote that he likes Arlo’s business but would prefer to own the company through Netgear, which currently owns 84% of Arlo’s stock and plans to distribute its ownership interest to shareholders.

“Given the stock’s already-rapid recent appreciation, [we] now see even more potential upside by buying it through parent Netgear,” he wrote.

Arlo IPO: 5 things to know about the Netgear security-camera spinoff

Otherwise, Cihra is upbeat about Arlo’s market opportunity as well as its ability to contend with tech giants like Amazon AMZN, +1.43% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.00% GOOG, +0.92% , which are also in the home-security business.

“Arlo/Netgear has a history of outmaneuvering behemoths,” he wrote. Cihra argues that Arlo can distinguish itself through its platform-neutral position and its emphasis on “focused Wi-Fi engineering,” a Netgear specialty.

Raymond James analyst Adam Tindle took a similarly positive view of Arlo’s technology strengths, but he deemed the company a “high-risk” bet due to the competitive environment as well as “the potential for substantial downside in consumer technology IPOs,” as evidenced by the stock performance of Fitbit Inc. FIT, -2.24% and GoPro Inc. GPRO, +0.24% following their initial public offerings. Tindle rates Arlo at market perform.

Deutsche Bank’s Sherri Scribner was more optimistic, beginning coverage with a buy rating and $28 price target, writing of the company’s technological advantages over its peers as well as its plans to get more serious about recurring services revenue through a platform it calls Arlo Smart.

“We believe Arlo Smart’s features will be attractive to a growing subset of Arlo’s hardware customers and will drive increased adoption of Arlo’s services offerings,” she wrote. “With services gross margins in the 50-60% range, well above hardware margins in the 20-30% range, services growth should drive margin expansion for the company over time.”

As it stands, Arlo generates the overwhelming majority of its revenue from hardware sales. Raymond James’ Tindle argues that while the services business represents an intriguing opportunity, it’s still “unproven,” as Arlo just recently launched the subscription-based offering. “The competitive differentiation is not as obvious to us” in services as it is in hardware, he said.

Optimism for Arlo stems not just from the company’s potential to generate more recurring revenue but also from its efforts to attract new types of customers.

Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone, who rates the stock at outperform with a $28 price target, predicts that the company can benefit from increased interest in do-it-yourself security from more than just homeowners. He sees construction sites, local government agencies, and events as other good use cases for Arlo’s products.",2018-08-28,Amazon
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/theres-a-shooting-star-in-the-way-of-amds-stock-rising-higher-2018-08-28,"For a long time Amazon has been a favorite of the momo (momentum) crowd in this momentum-driven stock market.

Amazon AMZN, +1.46% had been consistently ranked No. 1 in money flows. Recently all the planets aligned for AMD AMD, -3.27% and AMD dethroned Amazon to become No. 1. The planetary alignment for AMD included troubles at competitor Intel INTC, -0.22% a new product introduction, a technical breakout, a short squeeze and an analyst setting a $30 share-price target based on his information that many institutions were looking to take big positions in AMD.

Now there is a so-called shooting star getting in the way. Let us explore with the help of a chart.

Chart

Please click here for an annotated chart of AMD along with the technical analysis. Please note the following:

• The chart shows the formation of a shooting star, a reversal pattern. A shooting star is characterized by the open price, close price and low price of the day in proximity to each other along with a long upper shadow. In plain English, a long upper shadow means bulls ran up the stock a significant amount from the open but failed to hold the high and the stock closed near the open and the low.

• The shooting star formation in the case of AMD is a weak one because the smart money (professional investors) stopped selling near the close.

• The chart shows the major technical breakout for AMD.

• The chart shows when AMD dethroned Amazon and became No. 1-ranked based on the ZYX Change Method. Please see “AMD dethrones Amazon in investor money flows.”

• The chart shows that when the momo crowd was aggressively buying AMD stock, running it up over $27, the smart money started aggressively selling. The trigger for smart-money selling appeared to be the ending of this leg of the short squeeze and a bullish analyst’s call.

• Selling by the smart money and the ending of the short squeeze caused the stock to move down. The momo crowd continued to buy during the pullback but could not overcome the selling by the smart money.

• The chart shows that the relative strength index (RSI) is very overbought and the momentum is waning. This makes the stock vulnerable to a short-term pullback.

• The chart shows that the shooting star was formed on very heavy volume. This is considered bearish.

$30 magnet

A target price of $30 is acting as a magnet for the momo crowd. If the overall market weren’t so bullish and momentum-driven, there would have been a high probability of AMD giving up about one-half to two-thirds of its recent gains. Subscribers to The Arora Report are provided a precise buy zone.

A positive source of buying for AMD may come from analysts’ upgrades. Even though the stock has performed well, many analysts are still not on board. If analysts give up their bearishness, their followers will buy, pushing the stock higher.

Semiconductor sector

The beauty of this market has been the rolling corrections. While individual sectors get hit, money rotates into other sectors, pushing the indexes such as Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.01% S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% Nasdaq 100 NDX, +0.47% and small-caps IWM, -0.26% higher. Moreover, the momo crowd has not relented. If the momo crowd starts feeling some pain and analysts’ upgrades do not come through quickly, a sharper pullback may happen.

Lately the semiconductor sector, represented by ETFs SMH, -0.06% and SOXX, -0.19% have undergone a correction. Now popular stocks such as Micron MU, -1.86% Applied Materials AMAT, -0.94% and Lam Research LRCX, -0.13% are showing signs of stabilization and potentially getting ready to move up. This is helpful for AMD to move up. Further, AMD’s main competitor in graphic chips, Nvidia NVDA, +0.86% keeps moving up.

It is important to know Arora’s Second Law of Investing: “No one knows with certainty what is going to happen next. The best that investors can do is to make decisions based on probabilities.” Probabilities favor a short-term pullback and then another attempt to push higher. Aggressive investors may consider scaling in the buy zone. The risk-reward is not favorable if you’re buying near the highs at this time. If the stock continues to run, there will be many opportunities to buy when the risk-reward ratio is more favorable. Risk-reward is not cast in stone and changes.

10-bagger

The probability of AMD becoming a “10 bagger” — a stock increase of 10-fold — like Nvidia is small but should not be ignored.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/despite-stock-records-bears-have-unfinished-business-with-market-morgan-stanley-warns-2018-08-28,"The recent record levels in the U.S. stock market have punished those who expected equities to turn lower, but at least one prominent skeptic is standing by his call.

Michael Wilson, the chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that despite the recent records on Wall Street, there are ominous trends occurring under the surface of the major indexes. These cautious signals suggest there’s more potential for weakness than may be immediately apparent, given both the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.31% closed at records on Monday.

“Over the past two months, the U.S. equity market has moved decidedly more defensive and value is showing more persistent performance versus growth,” he wrote in a note to clients. The move to defensive sectors and value strategies, along with “weak breath and underperformance in former tech leaders,” are examples of the market “speaking loudly” with a view that is getting overshadowed by the indexes’ recent gains.

“The message?” he asked rhetorically. “The market seems to be (rightly in our view) worried about growth slowing later this year and next. The causes of the slowdown are obvious — tough comparisons, Fed tightening, cost pressures mounting, and the risk of trade tensions turning more consequential.”

In late July, Wilson wrote that Wall Street’s rally was showing signs of “exhaustion” and warned that investors should expect the biggest selloff since February’s market correction, which the Dow DJIA, -0.04% only officially exited on Monday. Thus far in August, the Dow is up 2.5%, the S&P is up 2.9%, and the Nasdaq has risen 4.5%.

The investment bank forecast “a rolling bear market,” and noted that “every sector in the S&P 500 has gone through a significant derating” with the exception of tech and consumer discretionary stocks, along with small-capitalization shares. In a follow-up report, Wilson said the bull market — which is by one calculation the longest in history — was in its “last innings” as these final untouched segments of the market’s rally were likely to undergo a similar drop.

Wilson affirmed this view in his latest note, writing that “the bottom line is that we think the rolling bear market that began in January has unfinished business with U.S. growth and small-cap stocks the most vulnerable.”

While recent gains in stocks have been broad-based — of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors, 10 are positive for the month of August — defensive groups have been notable gainers. The telecommunications sector is up 5.1% in the month, while health care is up 3.5%. So-called cyclical sectors, which tend to have a higher correlation to the pace of economic growth, have lagged. The materials sector is up less than 0.5%, while industrial shares are up 0.8%. Energy stocks are off nearly 3%.

A notable exception to the cyclical underperformance involves the FAANG stocks, or the quintet of major technology and internet stocks that have boosted the market for years. The tech sector is up 5.6% in the month, while consumer-discretionary names (which includes Amazon AMZN, +1.45% and Netflix NFLX, -1.37% ) are up 3.9%.

The gain in defensive sectors “has been even more dramatic than we envisioned at the time” of upgrading the strategy in June, Wilson wrote. “In fact, it’s been one of the most persistent and one sided defensive rotations we can remember outside of a true growth scare.”

As this chart shows, the spread between cyclical and defensive stocks has dropped significantly in recent weeks.

To have the S&P 500 hit records at a time when defensive sectors are among the biggest gainers “is a rare combination in our experience,” Wilson wrote. “We have to respect the persistent strength of the U.S. stock market indices but think investors should continue to have more of a defensive and value tilt in their portfolios.”

There are “definitely times when a good defense is required to win the game. We think one of those times is now for investors.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-short-sellers-gutted-by-stealthy-short-squeeze-2018-08-27,"Short sellers of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have faced destruction in 2018, losing nearly $3 billion on paper in what one analyst contends is a prolonged “stealthy short squeeze.”

AMD AMD, -3.63% shares finished up 5.3% at $25.26 as Monday’s best-performing stock on the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% , for their highest close since September 2006. Shares closed higher for a seventh consecutive session Monday, and surged nearly 14% at one point to hit an intraday high of $27.30.

The stock’s also been the S&P 500’s best performer so far this year with a staggering 146% climb, easily outpacing the next highest gains of Abiomed Inc. ABMD, +1.64% , with a 103% gain, and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.40% , with a 90% gain. In comparison, the S&P 500 is up 8.4% for the year and the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.16% is up 11.5%.

Monday’s gains follow AMD’s unveiling its Radeon Pro V340 data center card on Sunday. More than 321 million shares had changed hands by the close, more than twice the volume of the second-most traded stock on the S&P 500 Monday. AMD’s average daily volume for the past 52 weeks is 60 million shares.

Short sellers lost $177.5 million alone by the close Monday. At the session’s peak price, AMD short sellers had been more than $370 million in the hole, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.

In the past seven sessions, shares have rallied 31%. The last time AMD shares logged seven straight sessions of gains was a streak that ended on Nov. 21, 2016, which resulted in a 42% overall gain, according to FactSet data. Shares are also coming off their best week since the company released its Epyc chip more than a year ago with a 21% gain.

All told, short sellers have lost $2.67 billion as a result of AMD’s gains in 2018, Dusaniwsky said. That makes AMD the third-least-profitable short position for the year, with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.34% shorts losing $3.75 billion and Netflix shorts losing $3.43 billion, he said.

“This is a momentum market,” Dusaniwsky said in an interview. “These shorts have not been performing particularly well — it’s hard to fight the tide.”

In emailed comments, Dusaniwsky said that AMD short sellers have been locked in a “stealthy short squeeze” over the year.

“There was no one-day stock price spike that usually triggers a short squeeze, but rather it was a four-month steady thump of new year-to-date stock price highs that drove out 30% of the shorts since April,” Dusaniwsky told MarketWatch.

Short interest in AMD shares hit a record high in April, reaching 198.2 million shares, or more than 20% of shares outstanding. Short positions have fallen by 29.3 million shares, or nearly 18%, in August alone, costing short sellers $1.24 billion for the month. While unable to name names, Dusaniwsky said the biggest losers have been mainly quant shops as well as traditional long-short players.

AMD short interest is currently $3.32 billion, or 138.6 million shares shorted, making up 16.2% of the float, making it the third-largest short in the worldwide semiconductor sector behind Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.45% with $3.77 billion shorted, and Intel Corp. INTC, -0.25% , with $3.56 billion shorted, according to Dusaniwsky.

Of the 32 analysts who cover AMD, 13 have buy or overweight ratings, 14 have hold ratings, and five have sell ratings, with an average target price of $17.38, according to FactSet. AMD has produced profits in each of the last four quarters, after reporting losses in 12 of the previous 14 quarters, and recently reported its highest quarterly revenue since 2008.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-louisiana-ceo-explains-what-trumps-tariffs-have-done-to-his-manufacturing-business-2018-08-27,"My home state of Louisiana is Trump Country. Donald Trump’s promise to put America first and protect Americans from foreigners seeking unfair advantages, be it through immigration or trade, resonates deeply here.

Trump’s achievements in deregulation and reduced taxes have improved prosperity and economic opportunity for all Americans. The irony is that Trump’s trade tariffs jeopardize that progress and uniquely weaken Louisiana, with its heavy reliance on trade, its role as a home to agriculture and manufacturers, and its major ports at the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Our company, Laitram, LLC, is headquartered in Louisiana; like many American manufacturers we compete and sell products and services globally. We employ 2,500 people across 30 countries, in the manufacture and sale of specialized conveyor belts and equipment that improve productivity and food safety in global food processing, and capacity and reliability in high-speed package sorting such as UPS and Amazon.

Tariffs leave us at a competitive disadvantage to European, Canadian, Japanese and other foreign equipment manufacturers. With 25% import tariffs on foreign steel, we experienced an immediate 12%-14% increase in our steel prices, so foreigners now have access to cheaper steel and can offer domestic and foreign customers better prices. That is a huge problem for businesses like ours, and even bigger is the uncertainty of future tariff changes. That uncertainty creates risk that causes businesses to downshift and delay investments that increase productivity, capacity and competitiveness. We fall behind while our competitors improve, and our delays are lost business for our suppliers and their suppliers.

Most capital investment decisions execute over many months and even years, so it’s far too early to expect tariff impacts in the data. But we’re hearing lots of longer-term concern from customers, and our conveyor-belt business did experience a sudden slowdown in booked orders in June and July — from 18% growth to flat compared to the same months last year.

Complex manufacturers and services are particularly vulnerable to the impact of tariff-induced price swings.

What if our lost growth is a canary in the coal mine that becomes a downturn taking many months and years to repair? How do we measure changes in investment decisions that execute over long time periods?

Complex manufacturers and services such as high-speed package sorting, with their countless specialized processes and controls, are particularly vulnerable to the impact of tariff-induced price swings. Equipment and components are sourced globally so as to be state-of-the-art reliable, and provide the best function and value. And each system is designed to integrate particular components. With dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of components in a single system, each new tariff—and potential tariff—changes the structure of client and supplier contracts. Suddenly production costs become unpredictable, and priorities shift from developing new products to retrofitting existing products for different parts.

Read: Factory slowdown is behind weaker Chicago Fed’s national economic index for July

As a manufacturer of complex systems, we may be an early bellwether for what’s at stake for America. So, let’s please step back and ask: What problem are we trying to solve with trade tariffs?

Is it the trade imbalance? The United States trade deficit is exactly offset by the foreign investment surplus; both the trade deficit and the foreign investment surplus swell in U.S. economic expansions, and shrink in downturns. For example, we experienced a record 38% reduction in the Great Recession of 2009 and expect the trade deficit to be a record $850 billion in 2018.

Is it the absence of a level playing field due to asymmetric tariffs or subsidies? Then let’s negotiate a tariff-free, subsidy-free trade agreement with all comers. Is it China’s intellectual property transgressions or other trade rule violations? Then let’s stand with our allies and seek resolution multilaterally.

Trade-war tracker: Here are the new levies, imposed and threatened

When we conflate the issues to the single charge that “they” are cheating “us,” we elevate emotions and cloud understanding of the issues. This risks the train wreck of trade wars, such as the one inspired by the 1930’s Smoot-Hawley Act that led to as much as a 33% contraction of the global economy. Ultimately it even risks real wars, with bombs and human carnage.

International trade is not a national contest, like the World Cup, where exports are our goals, imports are the other country’s goals, and there is a winner and a loser. International trade is a win-win undertaking where the aggregate numbers are simply the cumulative total of millions or billions of daily transactions, where all participants come out ahead. When were you cheated by someone who gave you too low a price or too good a deal? How can the sum of too many good deals hurt America?

Let’s call time, park our emotions, and set the example by lowering U.S. tariffs. We can then challenge the world to do the same. If others follow, we’ll have a more peaceful and prosperous world; and if not, we’ll continue to prosper, and set an example that illustrates the connection between the liberty and prosperity.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-brain-wants-to-make-you-broke-and-what-to-do-about-it-2018-08-27,"Despite good intentions, we’ve all made money decisions that come back to bite us—from mindlessly binge-shopping on Amazon to selling off stocks when prices fall and locking in losses.

“Money is an extremely emotional subject,” says Frank Murtha, Ph.D., co-founder of MarketPsych. “It tends to create subconscious biases that we don’t realize creep into the decision-making process and steer us away from what’s rational.”

Identifying those unhealthy mind-sets is the first step to overcoming them. Here are six common ones—and how to keep them from sabotaging your finances.

1. Mental accounting

A dollar is a dollar, right? But sometimes, we treat money as though it’s not all equal—like blowing a tax refund or bonus because it feels like free money.

To counteract this tendency, set parameters ahead of time so you know exactly where your dollars will go and don’t overindulge. For example, if you know you’ve got a bonus coming, make a rule that you can spend, say, 25%, and invest the rest. “You still get the reward, but not at the cost of your better judgment,” Murtha says.

Then tell your spouse or a trusted friend about your plan. “It’s easy to let yourself off the hook,” Murtha says. “But involving a second person will help hold you accountable.”

2. Hindsight bias

Maybe you passed up the chance to buy Facebook stock, even though you had a hunch the company would be big. Or maybe you sensed your company’s financial troubles months before layoffs started, but didn’t look for other gigs. Now, you’re kicking yourself, thinking you knew it all along, but failed to act.

“Hindsight bias is the phenomenon in which a past event seem to be more prominent [or predictable] than it appeared at the time,” Murtha says. “It can lead you to engage in risky behavior to make up for action not taken.” If you’re filled with regret, you might buy into reckless investment opportunities or overreact to shifts in the market.

Inoculate yourself by jotting down pros and cons before making any big money moves. Not only will it help ensure a logical analysis, but you can look back at your decision-making process later, if remorse creeps in, and give yourself credit for doing the best you could based on the info at hand.

3. Short-term framing

“Live in the now” is great when you’re doing yoga or hanging out with your friends or family. But leaning into your brain’s wiring for short-term pleasure can wreck your financial life.

“The key to competing against the strong pull of your present emotions and motivating yourself to save is to feel it in your heart, not just your head,” Murtha says. “You need to go beyond simply visualizing your goals, and allow yourself to form an emotional attachment to them.”

Murtha suggests a technique he calls the mental slideshow. “Create a vivid slideshow of what you want your life to be like,” Murtha says. “Let that seep into your soul and have some staying power.”

4. Ostrich effect

It’s no surprise that many of us would rather bury our heads in the sand than deal with stressors like overdue bills, debt and filing taxes. “Recoiling from uncomfortable financial information is a coping mechanism,” says Certified Financial Planner Richard Kahler, president of Kahler Financial Group. “The majority of people are wired to flee from difficult emotions.”

While we know that ignoring problems only makes them worse, Kahler explains that this flight instinct is embedded deep in our limbic system (the most primal part of our brain), meaning it’s hard to change.

Your best bet for breaking free is to acknowledge your ostrichlike tendencies, and consider seeking expert intervention—or enlisting a friend as an accountability partner—to help you devise a plan to attack the issue head-on.

5. Anchoring

You nailed a job interview, but the employer lowballs you. Don’t fall prey to “anchoring,” when you undersell yourself in negotiations because you’re influenced by the initial offer.

“Anchoring happens because we might be hesitant to argue with an authority figure, like the hiring manager,” Kahler says. “Low self-esteem can also play a part—we begin to question our value.” What’s more, if you’re underpaid at your current job, that can shape how you (and others) assess your worth. In fact, this effect can be so strong that some states have banned managers from asking about previous compensation.

The fix? Know your market value so you can make a fact-based case for the salary you want. And remember the first offer is a starting point.

6. Decision fatigue

Maybe you click on Instagram ads while scrolling before bed, splurge on $14 cocktails after work or overbuy at the grocery store on your way home. Chances are, you’re experiencing the effects of decision fatigue.

According to research, the more choices you face, the harder it becomes to make reasonable economic judgments. Turns out, decision-making is like a muscle: Just like you run slower and sloppier at the end of a long treadmill session, your ability to make wise decisions depletes after making a series of small choices (white or gray shirt?).

When you have a major decision on the horizon, tackle it in the morning, when you’re sharpest. And to protect yourself from impulse buys, eliminate as many inconsequential choices as you can. Wear a work “uniform,” take the same route to the office every day and don’t agonize over what to cook for dinner.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-your-children-can-teach-alexa-2018-08-09,"MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto, Amazon ‘Mama, can you hear me?’

“What do the wheels of the bus do?”

Alexa and Siri are nothing if not polite when they doesn’t understand a question. Adults know enough to try again and clearly annunciate. But what about kids? A new study by researchers at the University of Washington and published at the 17th Interaction Design and Children Conference, held in June in Trondheim, Norway, recorded 14 children aged 3 to 5 playing a Sesame Street Workshop game, “Cookie Monster’s Challenge” on a laboratory-issued tablet. But the researchers soon realized that children had their own challenges communicating with virtual assistants.

Children had difficulty trying to get a duck in the game to quack, and were told, “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite get that.” Some of the kids approached this problem differently from others. Of those 100 recordings, the children repeated their request 79% of the time. Some kept shouting “quack” while others tried to speak slower (“quaaack”). The children persisted 75% of the time without showing signs of frustration and only asked for help in 6 of the 100 recordings. The parents — not the children — decided to stop trying and declared a malfunction. Only then, did their children give up.

“Adults are good at recognizing what a child wants to say and filling in for the child,” said Alexis Hiniker, co-author of the study and an assistant professor at the University of Washington Information School. “A device could also be designed to engage in partial understanding, to help the child go one step further.” She said virtual assistants should ask follow-up questions to help kids as well as adults. “Instead of focusing on how to get the response completely right, how could we take a step toward a shared understanding?” (Amazon did not respond to request for comment.)

Don’t miss: Is Amazon’s Alexa smarter than Apple’s HomePod?

Smart speakers are creeping into U.S. homes. Earlier this year, Amazon released a $79.99 device, Echo Dot Kids Edition. Some 16% of Americans or 39 million people own a smart speaker, a recent survey by National Public Radio found. Of those, 11% had an Amazon Alex AMZN, +1.49% and 4% had Google Home GOOG, +0.93% That doesn’t include the millions of people who use Siri on their iPhones AAPL, +0.44% or voice-assistants on their Android devices. The most common tasks: playing music (60%), asking general questions (30%) and checking the weather (28%).

Language development occurs long before a child speaks and babies’ brains are equipped to understand more than one language and, Hiniker said, technology could play a valuable role in that. “Babies show a preference for the voices and even the language that they heard in utero,” Janet Werker, a language expert at the University of British Columbia, recently told Bold.expert, a blog about learning and development. “Listening, in early infancy, is essential for acquiring the syntax, sounds, and other aspects of language, enabling the child to understand and ultimately to speak.”

Hiniker says the persistent and patient reaction of the children in her experiment suggests there’s room for more sophisticated artificial intelligence to help children — especially those in multigenerational families where English is not the first language of members of the household. In fact, she has launched another study into how diverse, inter-generational families use smart speakers, and what communication needs are required. “They’re being billed as whole-home assistants,” she added. “Developers should be thinking about the whole family.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/swiss-startup-that-filters-plastics-out-of-water-is-eyeing-us-and-china-markets-2018-08-20,"A Swiss startup that sells a high-tech filter that removes pathogens from water, including plastic particles, is up and running almost a year after a crowdfunding campaign that helped it raise the funds needed to launch a product for home use.

Novamem is now selling about 100 of its DrinkPure filters a month, according to Chief Executive Christoph Kellenberger. The company raised more than $70,000 with its Kickstarter campaign, comfortably above its initial target of $40,000.

Novamem scaled back early plans to take DrinkPure everywhere from China to India to the U.S. and is now taking a more step-by-step approach, building its presence in Switzerland and Germany and expanding through an Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.42% sales channel that will eventually serve all of Europe, Kellenberger said.

“I was surprised to find so many customers in Switzerland, where tap-water quality is good, but we have really struck a nerve,” Kellenberger told MarketWatch. “Health is becoming a bigger issue, and people rally care about what they eat and drink and consume.”

The company used the proceeds of the crowdfunding campaign to buy injection molds and tools and to pay for marketing and shipping. The campaign also attracted orders for more than 1,000 units, helping get the business off to a healthy start. Novamem is now talking to potential partners in China, and it’s planning to come to the U.S.

The DrinkPure filter is made using a polymer flat-sheet membrane that has a very high asymmetric structure, meaning it has a number of thin layers with different structures and permeabilities. This structure allows water to pass readily through the membrane, while biological contaminants, such as bacteria, are retained.

The membrane is combined with other filter media (i.e., sediment pre-filter and activated carbon, which allow it to not only filter bacteria but also other contaminants that render tap water undrinkable without losing its high flux rate).

Novamem initially developed the technology for use in outdoor water filtration.

A basic DrinkPure costs $68.99 and can simply be screwed on to a faucet. The filter can be used to purify up to 130 gallons of water, and a replacement costs just $25. The company is expecting to help reduce the use of plastic bottles, which are not just expensive but also wasteful. It takes about three liters of tap water to produce a single liter of bottled water.

Americans are drinking more bottled water than ever, and the category is the leader in the nonalcoholic-beverage market, according to industry tracker Beverage Marketing Corp.

Companies are getting on board, too, with McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +0.61% , Starbuck’s Corp. SBUX, +0.17% and major hotel chains scrapping single-use plastic straws.

The Invesco Water Resources ETF was up 0.5% on Monday and has gained 19% in the last 12 months. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% has gained 18% in the same period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.09% has added 19%.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/la-z-boy-stock-enjoys-best-day-in-more-than-a-year-after-earnings-beat-2018-08-22,"Shares of La-Z-Boy Inc. surged the most in more than a year Wednesday, after the maker of the iconic recliner blew past earnings estimates for its fiscal first quarter.

La-Z-Boy LZB, -0.30% said it earned $18 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $48 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose nearly 8% to $384.7 million and retail same-store sales turned positive after several weak quarters. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected La-Z-Boy to report earnings of 25 cents a share on sales of $368 million for the quarter. Shares jumped more than 14% in Wednesday trade.

Chief Executive Kurt Darrow said the company closed two acquisitions just after the quarter end, of e-commerce furniture seller Joybird, which is popular with millennials, and nine Arizona L-Z-Boy Furniture galleries, which include four of the highest sales volume locations in the 351-store network.

The two deals are expected to add about $80 million to fiscal 2019 revenue and to slightly boost earnings, excluding purchase accounting charges.

“Importantly, the Joybird acquisition will help La-Z-Boy expand its e-commerce capabilities (less than 5% of total sales) and attraction to a younger customer base, a demographic that it underpenetrated, historically,” Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch wrote in a note.

On a conference call with analysts, Darrow said the company is pleased with how its three-prong e-commerce strategy is progressing. That strategy includes selling more products through the La-Z-Boy.com, Wayfair Inc. W, -1.37% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.49% ; leveraging the supply chain to support other e-commerce brands; and investing in early-stage furniture brands that sell directly to consumers, the fastest-growing segment of the furniture market.

“Joybird will provide us with a greater presence online and allow us to more easily and effectively reach millennial and Gen X consumers who often prefer the mid-century modern product and styling that Joybird offers and the ability to shop through the online channel,” he told analysts, according to a FactSet transcript.

Joybird was set up by four individuals in 2014 and has grown to $55 million of annual sales in just four years, he said.

Still, the company is concerned about the threat posed by the tariffs and other trade tensions currently brewing between the administration of President Donald Trump and China, Europe and other major trading partners.

“Our team is keeping a watchful eye on the developments and is working with our industry association, the American Home Furnishing Alliance in lobbying efforts,” he said. “The Association’s position mirrors ours and that these duties are not good for the consumer, nor are they good for the majority of our industry.”

The retaliatory surtax went into effect on goods being exported to Canada in July and La-Z-Boy is watching to see how it will impact volumes. But the bigger fear is phase three, which is “pretty much a tariff on anything in the furniture business coming in from China.”

The list includes fabrics, leather and finished goods.

“What really has the industry perplexed is, we understand products that can be bought in both countries and whether or not there’s fair trade going on. But there is very minimal supply of fabrics and leathers in this country that the industry can buy, and most of it comes from China,” he said.

Other furniture stocks were also higher Wednesday, with Conn’s Inc. CONN, -0.89% up 3%, RH, -1.84% the former Restoration Hardware, up 3.4% and Wayfair W, -1.37% up 1.3%.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/victorias-secret-parent-cuts-guidance-again-and-stock-promptly-tanks-2018-08-23,"Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc.’s stock was slammed Thursday after the company cut guidance for the second time this year, as the Pink line, which targets a younger, college-educated consumer, continued to stall.

Same-store sales at Pink fell in the mid-single-digit range for a second straight quarter, Denise Landman, CEO of that operation, told analysts on the company’s earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. But lingerie and lounge wear — pajamas — also saw declining sales, while the swim category, which Victoria’s Secret is exiting, continued to be a drag, she said.

Landman is leaving the role at the end of the year and will be replaced by Amy Hauk, who is currently president for merchandising and product development at Bath & Body Works, another L LB, -2.69% business.

The company cut its full-year per-share guidance to $2.45 to $2.70 from a previous range of $2.70 to $3. For the third quarter, it said it expects to break even or earn up to 5 cents a share, well below the FactSet consensus of 10 cents, with margins expected to remain under pressure and sales, general and administrative costs expected to rise more than 200 basis points.

Instinet analysts said the second cut in guidance is a dynamic that has not been seen in years and makes it difficult to overlook the clear struggles at the business.

The earnings “raised a number of red flags (severe margin contraction at LB, bloated inventory, BBW returning to margin contraction and critically issues at PINK are proving hard to ignore),” analysts led by Simeon Siegel wrote in a note.

JPMorgan said the company has not forecast a break-even EPS quarter for more than a decade and fretted that the management transition would create business disruption.

“The LB long pitch primarily predicated upon “mindset” change at Victoria’s Secret (swim/sport/leadership) is now more complicated in our view with the turnaround timeline currently undefined at two of the company’s three concepts despite operating in arguably the best underlying consumer backdrop in over a decade,” analysts led by Matthew Ross wrote in a note.

AT MKM Partners, analyst Roxanne Meyer summed it up by saying L Brands is “no closer to bringing sexy back,” and agreed that its struggles come at a time “when the consumer appears to be its healthiest and most willing to spend on apparel and other items since pre-recession, and underscores the degree to which issues are self-inflicted.”

Victoria’s Secret has experienced sales challenges for several quarters, as customers shift their preference to less expensive bralettes, which don’t have padding, as opposed to the higher-priced “constructed” bras, like the Very Sexy line that Victoria’s Secret is known for.

The brand is facing competition from the likes of American Eagle Outfitters Inc.’s AEO, -12.02% Aerie brand in the bralette category, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.40% , which has a growing roster of private labels and is selling low-cost bras.

Also: Amazon’s apparel business could grow to as much as $85 billion in sales by 2020

“We can’t help but think the cure goes well beyond newness in lingerie, particularly since all VS merchandise categories experienced declines in merchandise margins,” Meyer wrote in a note.

The path to stabilizing the business will likely be long, she said.

‘It will take time to evolve the assortment, to wean the customer off of intense promotions, and to acknowledge that perhaps there’s a branding/image issue. In the near term, ramping up pajamas could be an opportunity and could help mask some of the pain as sport did ... but it is not the solution.”

MKM and Instinet rate L Brands neutral with a $31 stock-price target JPMorgan also has a neutral rating on L Brands but lowered its share-price target to $26.

L Brands said it earned $99 million, or 36 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $139 million, or 48 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Net sales rose to $2.98 billion, compared with $2.76 billion a year ago. Comparable-store sales rose 3% in the quarter.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected L Brands to report earnings of 34 cents a share on sales of $2.98 billion.

L Brands shares tumbled 10.7% Thursday to their lowest level since January 2011. Shares have fallen 52% in 2018, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% has advanced 7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% has gained 4%.",2018-08-23,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/many-older-americans-are-living-a-desperate-nomadic-life-2017-11-06,"In her powerful new book, “Nomadland,” award-winning journalist Jessica Bruder reveals the dark, depressing and sometimes physically painful life of a tribe of men and women in their 50s and 60s who are — as the subtitle says — “surviving America in the twenty-first century.” Not quite homeless, they are “houseless,” living in secondhand RVs, trailers and vans and driving from one location to another to pick up seasonal low-wage jobs, if they can get them, with little or no benefits.

The “workamper” jobs range from helping harvest sugar beets to flipping burgers at baseball spring training games to Amazon’s AMZN, +1.49% “CamperForce,” seasonal employees who can walk the equivalent of 15 miles a day during Christmas season pulling items off warehouse shelves and then returning to frigid campgrounds at night. Living on less than $1,000 a month, in certain cases, some have no hot showers. As Bruder writes, these are “people who never imagined being nomads.” Many saw their savings wiped out during the Great Recession or were foreclosure victims and, writes Bruder, “felt they’d spent too long losing a rigged game.” Some were laid off from high-paying professional jobs. Few have chosen this life. Few think they can find a way out of it. They’re downwardly mobile older Americans in mobile homes.

During her three years doing research for the book, conducting hundreds of interviews and traversing 15,000 miles, Bruder even tried living the difficult nomad life; she lasted one workweek. I recently interviewed Bruder to learn more about the lives in Nomadland and what the future holds for these people:

Next Avenue: How did you come to write “Nomadland?”

Jessica Bruder: It grew out of a story I wrote for Harper’s in 2014. I had read a story in Mother Jones and it mentioned a woman working in a warehouse who was living in an RV and said she couldn’t afford to retire. I went ‘Goodness!’ Call me naive, but when I see an RV, I assume it’s owned by one of the last of great pensioners enjoying retirement and going to see the National Parks. I regarded it as a life of luxury and a neat retirement choice. After all, they call them ‘recreational’ vehicles.

I started doing some research and learned there was a whole spectrum of thousands of employers hiring people in similar situations — in oil fields, harvesting sugar beets and helping out at amusement parks. These are not easy jobs or the kind typically associated with people in older stages. But nobody had been looking at it in context of the retirement crisis in the wake of the Great Recession. And a lot of the recruiting materials for these jobs made them look like summer camps. Some for Amazon’s CamperForce said if you come, you’ll make friends. It felt so strange to me, so I started talking to RV’ers outside Amazon warehouses in Nevada and Kansas. Some lost their savings; some thought they would retire on the equity in their homes, but their homes dropped in value dramatically, while the cost of traditional housing kept going up. A lot of them were living hand to mouth; it was hard for them to save for tomorrow.

What else were the people like who you met in “Nomadland?”

The people I met on the road were so creative and resilient and I spent time learning from them. Following them was the most exciting opportunity I’ve ever had.

Why do you think so many older people are living and working this way?

I think it has been the pretty bad economic times. We saw in the 1980s a shift from pensions to 401(k)s; that was a raw deal for workers. These retirement plans were marketed as an instrument of financial freedom, but they were really transferring risk from the shoulder of the employers to the backs of the workers.

I met a lot of older women. The gender wage gap has meant women have lower lifetime earnings than men; they spend more time out of the workforce doing unpaid labor, raising families or caring for parents.

Do you have any sense about whether the numbers of people in “Nomadland” are growing and why?

Anecdotally. Amazon’s CamperForce says it’s getting more and more applications. And when I track Facebook FB, -0.37% groups of these people, they’re all exploding. There are probably in the tens of thousands of people in Nomadland, and that’s being conservative.

Why do Nomads live like this?

We live in a culture where if your number didn’t come up, you’re a bad person, you’re lazy, you should be ashamed of yourself. It eats away at people. It makes them more exploitable.

What are the challenges they face?

I talked to one couple, Barb and Chuck. He had been head of product development at McDonald’s MCD, +0.57% before he retired. He lost his nest egg in the 2008 crash and Barb did, too. One time, Barb and Chuck were standing at the gas station to get $175 worth of gas and the horror hit them that their account had $6 in it. The gas station gentleman said ‘Give me your name and driver’s license and if you write a check, I will wait to cash it.’ He waited two whole weeks before he deposited it.

These jobs can be rough physically, right?

I know someone in his 70s who walked 15 miles on a concrete floor, sometimes for 10 hours. Your feet can get messed up, you can get repetitive stress injury and a tendon condition. The Nomads talked to me about soaking their feet in salt baths at night and being too tired to go out. When I went to the sugar beet harvest, it was 12 hours a day in the cold, shoveling. Oh my God, my body hurt! And I was 37!

Tell me about Amazon’s CamperForce program, which hires thousands of Nomads.

It began in 2008, within months after the housing collapse. Amazon contracts with an RV park and pays the CamperForce to do warehouse work loading and packing and order fulfillment. From the outside looking in, you’d say: ‘Why would you want older people doing this? The jobs seem suited to younger bodies.’ But so many times, the recruiters in the published materials talk about the older people’s work ethic and the maturity of the workforce and their ‘life experience,’ which is a code word for ‘Hey, you’re old.’

You write that sometimes the Nomads are exploited. How?

I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Forest Service and learned that some of their workers aren’t getting paid for all their hours. They weren’t allowed to invoice.

Some of the Nomads had to work alongside robots, such as in the Amazon warehouses. How was that?

The robots were making them bonkers. This is isolating work and there’s one scene in the book where a robot kept bringing a woman in her 70s the same thing to count.

What needs to change to prevent people from having to become Nomads or to help them live better if they are?

For one thing, Amazon should pay its workers more and give them better working conditions. It’s laughable that the workers get a 15-minute break when they have to spend it walking to the break room. It’s completely insane.

Nomads need a voice, but at the same time, it’s extremely unlikely that they’ll organize for better working conditions because they’re vulnerable and always on the move.",2017-11-06,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/retailers-are-hot-again-here-are-the-earnings-and-sales-winners-2018-08-23,"For a time it seemed as if the entire U.S. retail landscape would eventually get squashed by Amazon.com.

But all of a sudden retailers are reporting surprising news: Consumers have ramped up spending, which has sent their sales, and shares, soaring.

We’ll look at the data behind the excitement and list this quarter’s earnings winners and sales winners.

The federal tax cuts signed into law by President Trump in December weren’t fully implemented by U.S. companies until the middle of the first quarter. So second-quarter earnings season was the first to incorporate the full effect of the tax cuts. That helped earnings, while strong consumer spending powered sales.

Don’t miss: These seven stocks prove that retail is roaring

We’re going to show several sets earnings and sales data for retail companies included in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, which is made up of the large-cap S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -0.23% and the S&P 600 Small-Cap Index SML, -0.35%

The data

Starting with the S&P 1500 Composite Index, we arrived at a list of 83 retail companies, including Amazon.com AMZN, +1.49% and other online retail specialists. First we’ll look at earnings growth and then sales growth.

Second-quarter earnings season is nearly over; however, many companies have fiscal quarter end dates that do not match the calendar, especially in the retail world. So these comparisons are for each company’s most recently reported quarter through Aug. 22, from a year earlier.

Earnings growth winners

Unfortunately, a company’s bottom-line earnings for any one quarter can be confusing because it might be grossly distorted by one-time accounting charges, as well as extraordinary expenses from restructuring, legal settlements or any number of corporate events. This is why investors focus on so many other metrics, including sales growth, comparable-store sales growth, profit margins, etc.

With that said, here are the 20 S&P 1500 profitable retail companies showing the largest increases in quarterly net income according to reports filed through Aug. 22:

You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including corporate profiles, news, charts and financials.

As you can see, this approach can lead to some very large swings in earnings, especially if profits in the year-earlier quarter were low. We have also included changes in earnings per share, as these reflect any dilution from the issuance of new shares, as well as any boosts to EPS from buybacks.

Amazon leads the list for earnings growth, although investors over the long term have grown used to the company typically showing low profitability as it invests in various business units.

It is, of course, good to see earnings go up so significantly. But again, keeping in mind the potential distortion of earnings results, sales figures can be much more useful. Here are sales growth figures for the same group of 20 “retail earnings winners”:

The sales figures can be much more meaningful than one quarter’s worth of earnings figures that have been affected so dramatically by tax cuts. Here’s one more table to shed light on the quality of the sales figures for our retail earnings winners — gross margin, along with total return figures for the stocks:

A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. It does not take overhead expenses into account but gives an indication of whether a company is being forced to lower its prices to increase sales or defend against competitors. If a company is showing a high level of sales growth while expanding the gross margin (as Amazon has done), it is a very good sign.

Sales growth winners

Here are the same three sets of data, this time for the S&P 1500 retail companies showing the largest increase in quarterly sales, rather than earnings. There is, of course, some overlap with the earnings winners.

Here are the 20 S&P 1500 retail companies showing the largest increases in quarterly sales, according to reports filed through Aug. 22:

Before showing the earnings results for the sales winners, here are gross margins and total returns for the group:

Here’s how sales winners’ quarterly earnings changed:

Be careful with superlatives

It’s easy to understand how a long-term trend (the crushing of traditional brick-and-mortar retail by Amazon and its best online competitors) can be temporarily reversed by an earth-shattering tax cut. But keep in mind that the fantastic year-over-year comparisons will not last. We only have two more quarterly earnings seasons that will show the full effect of the tax cuts. The excitement will end.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, MarketWisdom.com co-founder Ivaylo Ivanov called retail “the clear leader right now” in the stock market. You might think that two more quarters of wonderful earnings and sales comparisons make for a long-term investing thesis, but six months is actually a short period for serious long-term investors. Watch the headlines — they turn on a dime and are fashioned as if every investor is a professional day-trader.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-seven-stocks-prove-that-retail-is-roaring-2018-08-23,"If you think retail is dead in the age of e-commerce, you haven’t been paying attention lately.

Sure, it’s folly to bet against Amazon.com AMZN, +1.49% which has been gobbling up retail market share. But don’t think for a second that Amazon’s wins are devastating retailers.

Consider that the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -1.22% one of the most popular ways to play the sector, is up more than 14% this year to double the broader stock market. Amazon makes up a mere 1.3% of the fund, so don’t think this outperformance is just a trick of how it’s weighted.

Within the sector, individual stocks show even more profits. This proves that Amazon isn’t the only game in town for investors looking to play booming consumer trends right now.

Sure, not all is rosy at the mall. The troubles of J.C. Penney JCP, -1.62% and Sears Holdings SHLD, -2.80% as they slouch toward irrelevancy is proof that not all retailers will survive. And even retailers that aren’t quite as battered, like department store Macy’s M, -2.94% which recently slumped over 15% in a single day to a hit a new 52-week low, don’t exactly have a lot of wiggle room with investors.

Recent earnings reports from big-name retailers show in black and white why investors should have confidence, and why the momentum seems to be building, not slowing.

Here are seven stocks that are making big moves, and that prove the retail sector remains one of the strongest investment themes of 2018.

Target

One of the biggest stories in retail lately has been big box store Target TGT, -0.10% which is trading near all-time highs in the wake of strong earnings on Wednesday morning. There’s nothing to not like in the details — a beat on both the top and the bottom lines, raised guidance and the fastest same-store sales growth since the financial crisis of 2008.

Aside from the general choppiness suffered by the market at large in January, it has pretty much been a steady upward slope for TGT stock in the last year. Shares are up about 50% over 12 months, and show no sign of slowing.

Walmart

Not to be outdone, mega-retailer Walmart WMT, -0.25% reported its best same-store sales growth in a decade for the month that ended July 31. It also dropped impressive second-quarter numbers that showed shoppers are spending more per visit to its stores, but more importantly that it is tracking growth in e-commerce revenue of an impressive 40% this year over last.

Shares of this $260 billion merchant are still down over 10% from their February highs, but momentum is back, with WMT stock bouncing back 25% from its summer lows after significant gains since its Aug. 16 report.

Nordstrom

Digging into department stores next, Nordstrom JWN, -2.69% has risen about 15% in the past week or so, thanks to powerful performance. A recent earnings report showed a beat on the bottom line and increased guidance for the full year.

Like Walmart, however, the details were really what got investors to take note. Digital sales and e-commerce transactions grew to represent 34% of second-quarter revenue, up from 29% a year earlier, and a sure sign that JWN stock is figuring out how to connect with consumers even in the age of Amazon.

Home Depot

Another big name showing the strength of specialty retail is Home Depot HD, -0.09% Investors were skeptical of this stock earlier in the year, after the home-improvement chain posted weaker-than-expected margins in February and then missed on sales back in May.

But HD stock just came roaring back with a vengeance in its latest report. A big beat and raised guidance for the full-year restored confidence, with important big-picture numbers that included 8% revenue growth and 8% same-store sales growth as well as encouraging details like bigger average receipts show this stock remains a key retail name to watch.

TJX

Discounter TJX TJX, +0.00% offered another strong showing recently, with second-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street expectations. Its two main nameplates, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, combined for consolidated same-store sales of 7% to drive a beat on that metric as well; executives said increased customer traffic was a primary driver of growth.

TJX is among the top decile of best-performing S&P 500 components over the past 12 months, thanks to consistently impressive numbers, with returns of almost 40% since Jan. 1 vs. about 6% for the benchmark. Additionally, shares of TJX recently powered through their pre-recession peak of 2008 to set a new all-time record.

Urban Outfitters

Apparel company Urban Outfitters URBN, -2.66% saw total net sales rise about 14% in its most recent report, topping expectations, and posted a big beat on the bottom line to boot. As with other names on this list, enthusiasm from investors was built on these strong fundamentals as well as the details that showed “strong, double-digit growth” in URBN digital transactions, according to management.

URBN stock has admittedly been choppy, and some investors were burned as shares plummeted from a peak north of $47 in 2015 to a low of just $17 in the summer of 2017. The past 12 months have featured a more than 130% run for the retailer, however, and the stock remains within spitting distance of new highs despite recent volatility.

Kohl’s

Another stock that has been on a tear in the last year or so is affordable retailer Kohl’s KSS, -2.80% The company’s second-quarter numbers topped expectations on both sales and earnings, and KSS raised guidance for good measure.

There was a brief bit of profit taking — perhaps understandable since the stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months — but shares are trading near a new 52-week high and challenging levels not seen since 2015. Wall Street seems to expect these new records are a foregone conclusion, with analysts at Telsey Advisory group putting a new $99 target on the shares and analyst firm MKM Partners raising its forecast to $83 in the wake of the strong results.",2018-08-23,Walmart

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-turn-a-side-gig-into-serious-extra-money-2018-08-24,"I’ve always been a fan of quirky, one-of-a-kind gifts. But when I started making and selling them online on Etsy two years ago as a creative outlet, I never imagined my hobby would blossom into a reliable stream of passive income. And yet, so far, I’ve earned about $30,000 on top of my 9-to-5 income. I’m still learning as I go, but here are a few valuable pearls of wisdom I’ve picked up along the way.

1. Follow your passion projects.

I love a good pun and have learned that products with silly word play paired with cute illustrations make for crowd-pleasing gifts. (Think: a coffee mug that reads Livin’ la vida mocha.) Years ago, I started ordering custom items for family and friends, and, by the end of 2016, had a few extra lying around—so I figured I’d try selling them. I listed a mug on Etsy ETSY, -0.77% for $15, and was surprised to see it sell quickly. I didn’t net much, but something told me I’d stumbled upon a worthwhile side hustle.

The key, I’ve learned over the last two years, is that I’m working on something I think is fun. When you’re motivated by more than the bottom line, you’ll be more likely to go the extra mile without burning out.

2. Outsource tasks you can’t do (or hate).

Soon after opening my Etsy store, I started researching cost-effective ways to produce other punny items I couldn’t easily make by hand. That’s how I discovered print-on-demand companies that ship on your behalf. It’s an order-as-you-go option that takes a cut of each sale, but using them means my apartment doesn’t have to double as an inventory warehouse.

From there, I found graphic designers (through marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork) who could help bring my ideas to life for $10 to $30 per design. With partners in place, I hit the ground running, creating everything from funny doormats to wine labels.

Whether it’s administrative work, accounting duties or something else, I’ve learned that it’s worth investing in help when it makes sense. This way, you’re free to focus on other areas you like or are better at—and supercharge your business.

3. Understand your costs (really, really well).

Perhaps my most valuable side gig advice was born out of a big mistake: I ended up losing hundreds of dollars my first quarter in business because I forgot to take taxes and Etsy’s seller fees into account—something I wouldn’t have missed had I done a simple break-even analysis from the outset.

I also wish I’d had a better handle on my pricing. At first, I sold mugs for $16.99, netting me as little as 50 cents when all was said and done. Now that I better understand margins, I’ve upped my prices to $33.50—a 100-percent markup—and people are still buying.

4. Be intentional with your time.

Surprisingly, I haven’t sacrificed much time to grow my business. After some initial research about how to optimize my Etsy page so it’d appear in people’s Google searches (a slow, but very effective game), I now just work when I have free time—usually about 30 minutes a day.

The key is that I’m careful to spend that time as productively as possible. I typically work on my side business first thing in the morning, before I’m distracted or tired from other work, and complete at least one task, like fulfilling an order or implementing a new marketing tactic.

5. Look for ways to optimize or improve your process.

It’s been a slow, but mostly steady ride. (One exception: Holidays are always a boon. My second year in business, I sold more than 300 products and brought in $9,000 in three months alone.) Generally, I’m selling one or two items a day now, earning anywhere from $7 to $30 for each. I’ve also started selling on Amazon AMZN, +1.49% and my own site; diversifying where you can discover and purchase my products has earned me an extra $3,000 in sales to date.

Next on my list is learning more about securing licensing deals to get my products into bigger retailers. I’m also slowing down on creating new designs and repurposing old ones instead. If one was really popular on a mug, why not try it on a beach towel? This will help keep my costs low as I look toward the future: My five-year goal is to firm up a long-term pipeline of passive income.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-wrong-move-for-buy-and-hold-stock-investors-facing-a-bear-market-2018-08-24,"Don’t miss these top money and investing features:

Bull markets are for the winners, the risk-takers — those who know a good thing and know how to get it. And bear markets? They don’t come for the winners, who know when to cash in their chips and walk away. Winners are fearless and have nothing to fear: you make money when stocks go up, and you don’t lose when stocks go down.

What’s wrong with this picture? It doesn’t exist. It’s a story many believe — or are told to believe — to feel better about the uncertainty that faces every investor, from novices to experts. Savvy investors understand that risk and reward are joined at the hip; you can’t have one without the other. The key is taking only as much risk as you’re comfortable with. How much is that? Ask yourself this: If the stock market abruptly closed and trading was halted for a year, could you stand it?

If not, buy-and-hold investing may not be right for you. By its nature, buying a stock or a mutual fund and holding it for the long term means you will be tested time and again by a market that doesn’t know you own stocks and doesn’t care. Be willing and able to stick with your strategy through thick and thin, and back again. Otherwise you might find yourself in over your head when stocks go south. As famed investor Warren Buffett famously quipped: “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/time-to-buy-emerging-markets-and-seven-stocks-and-funds-to-consider-2018-08-23,"If you’ve been holding off on buying U.S. stocks because you’re wary about an upcoming correction, it’s time to check out emerging markets (EM).

Their correction has already happened. So they now look cheap. And near-term catalysts lie ahead, chiefly in the form of a decline in fears about a trade war, which will chip away at the dollar and drive EM shares higher.

The correction: As of last week, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down almost 20% from its late-January highs, compared with about a 1% decline in the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.12% That’s reduced emerging market stocks to their 10-year average valuation, a nice discount to where they were in January when the dumb-money crowd was piling in.

Now everyone hates EM again, so it is time to buy. Here’s what could send EM stocks higher, and seven ways to get exposure.

1. The dollar will weaken

While problems in Turkey recently put developing-country risk in the headlines, most of the EM stock market decline has actually happened since the dollar started rising from its bottom in April.

This makes sense because a strong dollar hurts emerging markets in two ways.

• A lot of emerging market companies sell commodities, and a strong dollar hurts commodity prices.

• Many EM governments and private companies have lots of debt denominated in dollars. So weakening EM currencies (i.e. a strong dollar) raise fears that they will have trouble paying back the debt.

Now the dollar is poised to fall, which will have the reverse effect. This will push EM stocks back up.

Why is the dollar about to fall? It went up on fears about trade wars. Now, trade-war fears will ease because President Donald Trump is smart enough to know he doesn’t really want one.

Sure, there’s still a lot of bluster from the White House about tariffs. But this is just a bargaining tactic to get foreign governments to soften up. And it seems to be working. China recently showed signs of folding on the trade-war issue, and bilateral talks on trade resumed.

In the background, the U.S. economy will slow after a robust second quarter. Heading into mid-term elections, Trump doesn’t want trade-war rhetoric to hurt the economy even more than it already has. So he’s ready to bargain, too.

“If the U.S. economy slows now, everyone is going to point to trade wars as the culprit. There will be pressure on Trump to get a resolution,” says James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. A lot of that pressure will come from within his own party, says Paulsen.

“I am optimistic that trade will get worked out,” agrees Charlie Wilson, co-portfolio manager at the Thornburg Developing World Fund.

2. The global economy will be fine

Many investors are fleeing emerging market economies for the U.S. “safe haven” because of fears about a slowdown in global growth. But this is mistaken. “Global growth is weak relative to last decade, but it is still chugging along,” says Wilson.

That will continue. Many central banks around the world are still easing, rather than tightening like the Fed, he notes. China has been lowering interbank lending rates and boosting infrastructure spending. Yields on 10-year bonds there have been falling, which encourages borrowing.

Next, emerging market economies are still in the early phases of their recoveries. Banks are looking healthier in Indonesia. The consumer is strong in India, where companies are posting better results as well, says Wilson. Most emerging market economies have younger populations than developed economies, which is good for growth.

“If the dollar comes off and the global economy stays in place, then I think you get a pretty healthy bounce in emerging markets,” says Paulsen.

3. Emerging markets are cheap

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at 11 times forward earnings, which is on par with its 10-year average, points out Wilson. That may sound ho-hum as a valuation. But you have to keep in mind that the composition of this index has changed in a way that means it should have a higher valuation than in the past, says Wilson.

It now has a lot more tech companies like Alibaba BABA, -0.49% Tencent TCEHY, -1.29% and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, -3.07% In the past it had a bigger weighting toward basic-industry, mining and commodity-oriented companies, which carry lower valuations than tech. “The quality of opportunities has improved over the past five years,” notes Wilson. “There has been a shift from heavy industry and commodity-driven growth to more interesting business models. The tech industry has become more important.”

4. There will be no contagion from Turkey

Emerging market currency declines in 1997-98 sparked an EM debt crisis that hit U.S. stocks hard. So worries about Turkey are understandable. But a repeat is probably not in the cards, says J.P. Morgan economist David Hensley. Trade with Turkey is relatively small. Banks outside Turkey are on the hook for about $265 billion in loans, mostly held by EU banks. But European banks have enough capital to avert a crisis.

Seven ways to get EM exposure

The Thornburg Developing World Fund THDIX, +0.05% that Wilson manages is one way to go. It has 86% of its assets invested outside the U.S., and it is on a roll because it outperforms competing funds by 1.7 percentage points in the past year, according to Morningstar. Wilson also singles out these two companies that trade on U.S. exchanges as American depositary receipts (ADRs).

Azul AZUL, -0.06% : As the name suggests (“blue” in Portuguese), this Brazilian airline was started by JetBlue Airways JBLU, +0.53% founder David Neeleman.

Azul is a regional airline in underserved markets that previously had no access to air travel. This makes it a play on the poor infrastructure in Brazil. The airline flies people to major hubs and air routes.

So far, it doesn’t have a lot of competition, and it may stay that way since the local markets Azul serves are not huge. As a niche player, Azul has pricing power to offset increases in fuel costs, or the hit to margins from the weakening Brazilian currency, says Wilson. (Some of Azul’s costs are in dollars.) The airline is improving margins by upgrading its fleet. It will also benefit from shipping deals with the Brazilian post office and Amazon.com AMZN, +1.49%

ICICI Bank IBN, +0.73% : ICICI Bank is a play on the growth of consumer banking in India, as more people earn more. This means they will buy more financial products like insurance, brokerage services and asset-management services. India also recently took large denomination notes out of circulation, which makes it harder to do large transactions off the books in cash. This is driving demand for banking products like savings accounts, checking accounts and mutual funds.

“ICICI Bank is one of the strongest consumer and deposit franchises in India,” says Wilson. “It has excellent consumer-facing franchises it is not getting credit for.” Why not? The bank has a lot of bad loans to businesses. But it is in the process of cleaning up its balance sheet, and it has the earnings power to get this done, believes Wilson.

Investors are not so sure. That’s why this bank trades for about one times book value, if you subtract the value of the shares of publicly traded subsidiaries it carries on its balance sheet. Retail banks typically trade for two or three times book value, so Wilson thinks ICICI Bank stock could double or more.

For emerging market exposure, also consider the four largest exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the space: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF VWO, -0.04% iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF IEMG, -0.05% iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM, -0.05% and Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF SCHE, -0.04%

Is it time to put money in Turkey? Maybe not. The government there has pursued high-growth, simulative policies for years. That brought growth. But also high inflation, which contributed to the currency decline that set off the current crisis.

To solve this problem, Turkey probably needs to sacrifice growth and use higher interest rates and government spending cuts to bring down inflation. Will it? “This could very easily be contained, but so far the government has not taken the necessary steps,” says Wilson. “They are not taking the concrete actions that I think the market needs to see right now.”

That suggests further weakness in the Turkish lira and the iShares MSCI Turkey Investable Market Index Fund TUR, -1.97% ahead. “What we learned from watching the Greek crisis is that if you don’t get ahead of these things aggressively, they can be a lot more painful than they need to be,” says Wilson.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-should-train-their-sights-on-how-cohen-and-manafort-could-affect-the-midterm-elections-2018-08-22,"A key to success in investing is to think ahead. A big event coming up are the November midterm elections.

Recent polls show that Democrats are resurgent. And the legal troubles of President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and former campaign Chairman Paul Manafort are going to give more ammunition to Democrats and distract Trump from his agenda.

So what does that mean for the stock market? Let’s explore with a chart.

Chart

Please click here for an updated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.08% which is based on the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.12% Please note the following from the chart:

• The chart shows the market starting to break out from the resistance.

• The chart shows the pullback below the prior resistance on the news related to Cohen and Manafort.

• The chart shows the key level.

• Bears look at the potential double top shown on the chart and stand their ground. A double top would be a big negative.

• Often in a situation like this, the relative strength index (RSI) is a helpful indicator. In this case, RSI can go either way.

• Divergence in RSI from the last peak shows that momentum has waned. This favors the bears.

• Volume is low. This indicates that there is no conviction.

• The pattern looks different for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.06% Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +0.43% and small-cap ETF IWM, -0.28%

Consumer confidence

The U.S. economy is about 70% consumer-spending-based. For this reason consumer confidence is important. Bulls argue that the market cannot go down because earnings are rising. Well, earnings are rising because of high consumer confidence. If a political crisis erupts, it may hurt consumer confidence, which in turn would hurt earnings. That should give investors a reason to be somewhat cautious going into the November midterm elections.

The leaders

The leaders of the stock market are not immune. In the bull market, it is important to look at the market leaders. When speculation arose about a guilty plea of Cohen and the conviction of Manafort, money flows abruptly turned from extremely positive to negative in market leaders such as Amazon AMZN, +1.49% Facebook FB, -0.33% Microsoft MSFT, +0.86% and Alphabet GOOG, +0.93% GOOGL, +1.01% Money flows also turned negative in popular semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia NVDA, +0.79% AMD AMD, -2.91% and Micron Technology MU, -1.81% Marijuana stocks such as Canopy Growth CGC, +1.22% Tilray TLRY, +13.26% and Cronos Group CRON, +6.93% were rocketing before the news. On speculation of the news, money flows turned from extremely positive to negative.

Future, not the past

The sum total of the foregoing is that, looking in the rear-view mirror, the market should rise. But one needs to look ahead. Investors should not make decisions based only on the chart above. They should look at a more comprehensive model with a proven record in both bull and bear markets. (An example is the ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation Model with 10 inputs.) Furthermore, markets are dynamic, and static models do not work over a long period.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-companies-move-to-a-semi-annual-reporting-schedule-probably-not-say-analysts-2018-08-17,"Should the U.S. move to a six-month financial reporting calendar from the current quarterly one as President Donald Trump mooted in an early Friday tweet?

Not really, according to many investors and analysts, who argue that shareholders need more disclosure from the companies they invest in and not less. And while many executives — Elon Musk, anyone? — argue that the burden of striving to meet quarterly estimates can lead to short-termism on the part of managers and shareholders, there’s no guarantee that a different reporting schedule would change that.

“If the charge is that companies are managing for short-term expectations, what will be the difference between a three-month cycle and a six-month cycle? Nothing,” said Leigh Drogen, founder and chief executive of Estimize, a platform that crowdsources earnings estimates and economic forecasts.

“A six-month cycle will also lead to increased volatility given less access to hard information regarding the performance of companies,” Drogen said.

“I understand CEOs’ frustration with short-term [reporting], but the solution is not to hide critical information from investors. [President Trump’s] proposal would raise the cost of capital for public companies and weaken our markets’ global competitiveness.” Mercer Bullard, Butler Snow lecturer, professor of law, University of Mississippi

Trump said that the idea of changing reporting requirements came from outgoing PepsiCo Inc. PEP, +0.50% Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, a longtime critic of the current system who has argued that the pressure to meet short-term goals clouds longer-term targets. The president has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the issue.

“I have the results to show for long-term management and the scars to show for short-term management, “Nooyi told a panel at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this year, as Business Insider reported.

The executive was harshly criticized by analysts during the period in which she worked to move PepsiCo away from sugary drinks and salty snacks toward healthier products with her “Profits with Purpose” strategy. After her first five years as CEO, there were calls for her ousting as sales slowed, profits missed targets and the stock languished.

Read now : Trump and Warren agree: Corporations are holding back the economy

Nooyi suggested her 12-year tenure as CEO would offer a good case study for her insistence on taking a longer view. PepsiCo has beaten profit estimates for the past 20 quarters, according to FactSet, as her strategy paid off and got the company back on a growth track.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said his agency has already implemented measures that aim to “encourage long-term capital formation while preserving, and in many instances, enhancing key investor protections.”

The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance “continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting,” he said in a statement.

But if the idea is to get companies to focus on longer-term results over shorter-term performance, some feel that increasing the time between reports by three months won’t make much of a difference.

“I think it’s negligible,” said Wayne Thorp, vice president and senior financial analyst at the American Association of Individual Investors. “It’s a step in the right direction, but I don’t think it would impact the individual investor that much. It’s lip service.”

To be sure, companies would prefer not to have the burden and expense of quarterly reporting, which includes the need to rehearse for conference calls with analysts. And companies have become expert over the years at gaming the system so that they beat consensus forecasts and enjoy the subsequent stock gains.

Also: Investors who paid attention to GE’s accounting saw trouble coming

That expertise has meant that earnings have beaten forecasts at a faster rate over time, as Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told MarketWatch in June.

“There is a tendency by corporations to set conservative numbers so that EPS beats come through,” Hall said.

Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG, +0.84% the former Priceline, for example, regularly offers soft earnings guidance, only to then “beat” that guidance when it reports, as MarketWatch has previously reported. See The Sniff Test about Priceline’s tendency to set the bar low.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett BRK.B, -0.06% and JP Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.35% Chief Executive Jamie Dimon have argued that companies should stop offering quarterly guidance and switch their focus to longer-term issues. The two executives support the release of quarterly earnings reports, but believe the practice of guiding for the next quarter creates short-termism that is damaging to the economy.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” they wrote in a Wall Street Journal commentary piece.

But John Kay, U.K.-based economist and author of “Other People’s Money: The Real Business of Finance,” says it’s the practice of reporting every quarter that causes short-term thinking.

“What is changing in three-month intervals does not tell us anything about how a company is positioned to deal with long-term growth,” Kay said in a recent interview with MarketWatch.

Read now: Critics say Buffett-Dimon plea to end quarterly guidance won’t end ‘short-termism’

Kay was tasked with reviewing activity in U.K. equity markets and the impact on long-term performance and governance of listed companies and recommended eliminating quarterly reporting in favor of six-month’s and phasing out guidance. His other recommendations included the adoption of a stewardship code, the establishment of a forum for collective engagement by investors, the clarification of fiduciary duties of trustees and their advisers, and the rebating to investors of all income from stock lending.

“Earnings reports cut through all the noise, and that’s what investors really need to see. It’s easy to get distracted. We need those earnings to keep [investors] on track, to keep them from going off the rails.” Karen Cavanaugh, senior market strategist, Voya Investment Management

The U.K. in 2014 dropped its quarterly reporting requirement, although about 90% of U.K.- listed companies still report that way, many because they are also listed in the U.S., the deepest and biggest capital markets in the world.

The academic world has attempted to evaluate the merits of quarterly versus semi-annual reporting with mixed results. A paper by Chicago Booth Professor Haresh Sapra and colleagues from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Minnesota published in 2014 found there’s a happy medium between too little disclosure and too much delivered too often.

“Since markets are forward looking, any actions that favor the short term at the expense of greater long-term value creation would be effectively punished by lower capital market prices,” said the paper. Overreporting can be expensive and could make it more attractive for companies to do anything to produce quick profits. “Such pressures disappear when reporting frequency is decreased,” the paper found.

But some industry analysts said reduced reporting could actually increase costs for companies, as lenders could require higher interest rates to compensate for the increased uncertainty from less information.

“I understand CEOs’ frustration with short-term [reporting], but the solution is not to hide critical information from investors,” said Mercer Bullard, Butler Snow lecturer and professor of law at the University of Mississippi. “[President Trump’s] proposal would raise the cost of capital for public companies and weaken our markets’ global competitiveness.”

Karen Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management, said regular earnings reports are necessary and good for investors, because they provide a check point on how macro developments, such as tax cuts and tariffs, can affect companies and the economy.

“Earnings reports cut through all the noise, and that’s what investors really need to see,” Cavanaugh said. “It’s easy to get distracted. We need those earnings to keep [investors] on track, to keep them from going off the rails.”

Howard Berkenblit, partner and head of the capital markets group at the law firm Sullivan & Worcester, agreed that quarterly reporting serves a “useful function” for both companies and investors.

For companies, reporting twice a year instead of four times would save some money and resources, but they could find it challenging to “talk freely” to institutional investors and lenders about their business and outlook, unless that information has been fully disclosed to the public, as Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) requires. And if companies are going to do the work to update investors, it wouldn’t be that much more of a burden to disclose the information officially, Berkenbilt said.

For investors, it’s hard to argue that less information is ever better than more information. And for small investors, who are already unable to keep up with high-speed and algorithmic trading machines that can scrape information from multiple sources in the blink of an eye would likely be even more disadvantaged if those programs were to become more aggressive.

“I see it as maybe a hard sell, since investors and analysts still want that information, and may not want to wait that long to know what’s going on with a company,” Berkenblit said. “Is the saving really worth it, for the benefit to the investment community that you give up?”

Drogen from Estimize said fans of long-term planning often use Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.46% as an example of a company that was able to thrive despite the many years in which it failed to show a profit.

“Investors love to point to Amazon and Jeff Bezos when it comes to long term thinking and investments, but they are sorely mistaken if they believe the market is willing to given that kind of benefit of the doubt to every managerial team,” he said.

“In a time when technological disruption risk is increasing significantly, investors need more information at a more rapid clip in order to assess the health of businesses, not less,” he said.

Amazon shares have gained 60% in 2018, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% has gained 6.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.01% has added 3.6%.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-slip-after-ex-trump-attorney-michael-cohen-says-he-broke-law-2018-08-22,"U.S. stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow snapping a four-day winning streak, as the minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee’s most recent meeting reaffirmed the central bank’s hawkish bias.

The publication of the Fed’s notes comes on a day when investors attempted to determine how the legal drama surrounding President Donald Trump will impact the market as stocks quietly marked the longest bull run in history.

What are the main benchmarks doing?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.06% slid 88.69 points, or 0.3%, to 25,733.60 and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% slipped 1.14 points to 2,861.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.33% bucked the trend to advance 29.92 points, or 0.4%, to 7,889.10, extending its gains to a fifth session.

Read: This bull market may soon silence all the critics

What’s driving markets?

The Fed minutes indicated broad-based support for another interest-rate hike in September with many officials stating that as long as economic data remain strong, “it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation.” However, they also suggested that any tightening will have to pause if the U.S. trade tensions with partners continue to escalate.

On the political front, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort late Tuesday was found guilty on eight charges including tax fraud, and the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen said he violated campaign-finance law at President Donald Trump’s direction.

The market has gingerly navigated trade-war worries between the U.S. and China as investors focused on reports showing a healthy U.S. economy and solid corporate earnings. But the uncertainty following the legal developments for the two former associates of the president could adversely influence financial markets, some analysts say.

Existing-home sales ran at a 5.34 million seasonally-adjusted annual rate in July, down 0.7% versus June, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.

What were strategists saying?

“Overall, nothing here to surprise the markets,” wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, following the release of the Fed minutes. “Attention will now switch to Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech this Friday. We expect him to deliver the same message on tightening evident in the minutes. We doubt that President Trump’s criticism is going to change anything,” referring to comments from Trump that he is “not thrilled” with central bank raising short-term rates.

“I think this political swirl around Trump has been happening for a year and half, but the market keeps telling that us that it doesn’t really matter because the economy is strong,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.

That said, the strategist indicated that investors should be mindful of rising inflation and the dollar which could pose a risk to the integrity of the record bull-market run. “I think that whenever you are at all time highs, you should always be a little cautious,” Kinahan said.

“I don’t think what happens with Trump is important to the market,” Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors, told MarketWatch.

She also said upbeat results from Target Corp. emphasized the perception that consumers are healthy and that the strongest among retailers are emerging from a period in which analysts and strategists believed Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.49% to be the slayer of bricks-and-mortar establishments.

“I think the most interesting thing are the Target numbers. The market would be a lot higher if it weren’t for this Trump overhang stuff,” Ogg said.

On Monday, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, +0.45% said it would pay $3.2 billion for SodaStream, a company that makes kitchen devices that carbonate water. The announcement follows Pepsi’s introduction of its ‘Bubly’ sparkling water brand in February 2018. Last year, Coca-Cola KO, -0.10% announced the acquisition of Mexico seltzer manufacturer Topo Chico.

“The flavored, zero-calorie and unsweetened concentrates that now form the centerpiece of Sodastream’s offering fit in with consumer weariness of not only sugar content, but also artificial sweeteners,” Alexander Esposito, industry analyst at Euromonitor International, said.

Soda companies are now focusing on “healthier, more sustainable beverages,” Esposito added. U.S. consumers guzzled 273.62 million gallons of sparkling bottled water in 2017, up from 90.83 million in 2012, according to data from industry research firm Beverage Marketing Corp.

While they still drink far more soda, those numbers are falling fast: Consumers drank 12.3 billion gallons of soda last year, down from 13.3 billion gallons in 2012. Consumers also drank 13.2 billion gallons of bottled water in 2017, up from just 9.5 billion in 2012, marking the first year that people drank more bottled water than soda.

The numbers analyzed by Euromonitor include seltzer and club soda in one “carbonated water” category.

There are three varieties of carbonated water: seltzer, which is spring water containing carbon dioxide; club soda, which contains potassium bicarbonate and potassium sulfate; and tonic, which is often put in another category because it includes sweetener.

Multiple studies have raised questions about the safety of artificially sweetened diet sodas, leading millions of consumers to opt instead for carbonated water, said Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing Corp. “Today’s consumers want healthier refreshment,” he said.

These bubbly waters are seen as a healthier alternative to sugary sodas, which have been linked to obesity and diabetes. Some studies have also raised questions about the safety of artificially sweetened diet sodas.

And yet the prices of cola and carbonated water are comparable: An eight-pack of Poland Spring carbonated water on Amazon AMZN, +1.49% is $4.99, the same price as an eight-pack of Coca-Cola. A SodaStream starter pack retails for $110.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-facebook-and-other-hedge-fund-favorites-are-biting-into-returns-2018-08-21,"2018 is shaping up as a tough year for equity hedge funds. A look at their favorite stocks, including Facebook, helps explains why, say analysts at Goldman Sachs.

In a late Monday note, the analysts said that nearly 100 hedge funds owned social-media giant Facebook Inc. FB, -0.34% as a top 10 holding at the beginning of the third quarter, keeping it at the top of Goldman’s Hedge Fund VIP list and weighing on performance as shares plummeted in July. Facebook shares fell more than 11% in July, continuing a volatile year. Shares are up 0.5% so far this month, leaving them down 1.7% in the year to date.

Goldman, whose VIP list tracks the most popular long positions held by 830 hedge funds, has suffered large performance swings this year (see chart below), lagging behind the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% by 500 basis points since June, the analysts said.

Declining net leverage as the equity market rebounded from its February swoon was another drag, the analysts said, while also noting that the biggest targets for short bets—wagers that stock prices will fall—have actually outperformed this year.

Goldman found that a basket of the 50 Russell 3000 RUA, +0.07% stocks with market caps of more than $1 billion and the largest outstanding short interest as a share of float has outperformed the S&P 500 by 14 percentage points, up 21% year to date versus 7% for the large-cap index.

After Facebook, the next most popular long positions were in Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.49% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.86% Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.01% and NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, -0.29% The top five have averaged a 0% return since the start of the third quarter, but have outperformed the S&P 500 in 62% of quarters since 2001, generating an average quarterly excess return of 54 basis points, or 216 basis points annually, Goldman said.

Meanwhile, Facebook’s plunge probably accelerated a rotation away from the technology sector to health-care stocks that was already in progress, Goldman said. Before its disappointing second-quarter earnings results, 230 hedge funds, accounting for 28% of Goldman’s sample, owned Facebook, making it the most popular position, with an average portfolio weight among those funds of 4%.

At the start of the year, 20 stocks in Goldman’s VIP list came from the tech sector, putting its share at 40%, the highest on record, the analysts said. At the time, only three health-care stocks, accounting for 6% of the basket, were on the list, the lowest representation since 2008. Goldman said its newly rebalanced basket shows a”modest shift” from tech to health care among the most popular positions, continuing a rotation that started in mid-2017.

Meanwhile, overweight positions in health care have been rewarded thanks to the combination of info tech volatility, mergers and acquisitions, and the easing of policy concerns, the analysts said. Health care has outperformed the S&P by 500 basis points over the last three months, they said.",2018-08-21,Goldman Sachs

Retail stocks deserve credit for powering the broad market higher, say StockTwits co-founder Howard Lindzon and MarketWisdom.com co-founder Ivaylo Ivanov for our call of the day.

The sector, whose biggest ETF XRT, -1.22% just scored an all-time high, features lots of winners that stock pickers ought to be tracking, according to Lindzon and Ivanov.

“The retail sector is the clear leader right now. We’re seeing so many breakouts in consumer stocks and in retailers,” Ivanov said during the duo’s weekly show.

The pair has named names, noting Best Buy BBY, -0.34% and Lululemon LULU, -2.06% have notched record closes. They also have flagged recent multiyear highs for Michael Kors KORS, -1.96% , Restoration Hardware parent RH RH, -1.84% , Boot Barn BOOT, -1.11% and Tilly’s TLYS, -2.25% .

The biggest retail ETF is hitting new heights.

The sector has its share of carnage, Lindzon acknowledged.

“Retail really is dead if you’re J.C. Penney JCP, -1.69% , if you’re Sears SHLD, -2.80% ,” he said.

But he’s upbeat on companies that seem to be changing more with the times. He sees potential for a re-imagining of the mall if the streaming-video heavyweights start using movie theaters for more than just standard showings of feature films. There is chatter around theater chains after last week’s news that Amazon AMZN, +1.49% might buy Landmark.

“The mall is not dead. If Amazon and Netflix get into the retail movie business, this is just a humongous boon for the last-standing stores in the mall,” Lindzon said.

Restaurant stocks such as Chipotle CMG, -1.18% are bouncing back as well, the duo pointed out. That’s as spending at restaurants reportedly surges to an all-time high.

“They don’t look as good as other retailers, but still they’ve come a long way since their lows,” Ivanov said.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/avoid-multidecade-growth-companies-in-emerging-markets-at-your-own-peril-2018-08-20,"Wise investors may want to consider the long-term growth of emerging-markets companies and forget the current turmoil.

Disruptions that have hit currencies in Turkey and Argentina have led to considerable volatility this year, but they don’t have anything to do with the long-term story of increasing spending power among consumers in many emerging economies.

Tony Arsta, one of the lead managers of the Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund TMFEX, +0.57% (the other is Nate Weisshaar), argues that many companies in emerging markets “have multidecade growth in front of them,” and that EM companies focused on local consumers with increasing spending power, such as Alibaba BABA, -0.48% “are just getting started.”

The Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund was established in 2011 and is small, with only $35 million in assets under management. But it has a four-star rating (out of five) from Morningstar. We’ll look at some of Arsta’s favorite stocks, but first, here’s a comparison of how emerging-markets stocks have performed against U.S. stocks.

Charts tell the story

Here are four charts comparing the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 891800, +0.03% with that of the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.12% First, 2018:

FactSet

And now a five-year chart:

FactSet

Ten years:

The 15-year chart is an eye-opener:

FactSet

The 10-year chart shows significant outperformance for U.S. stocks as it encompasses the domestic bull market that began in March 2009, as well as greater volatility of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index during that period. But as you go further out, the emerging-market economic growth story shines through.

So the longer-term chart makes a solid case for having broad long-term emerging-markets exposure as part of a diversified portfolio.

In an interview on Aug. 16, Arsta said that “over the past two decades emerging markets have been driven by exports to developed countries. So when there is a shock or slowdown in developed countries, it hurts EM.”

Recent currency shocks are in emerging markets, but not those showing the greatest increases in spending power among consumers. And we may be in for a developed-market shock with the new Italian government’s apparent resistance to the European Union’s suggested remedies for its troubled banking system.

But none of those short- to medium-term threats affect the long-term story of increasing spending power among consumers in China, many other Asian nations, as well as those in Africa and Latin America. So Arsta and his colleagues focus on emerging-market companies that derive most of their growth from the increased spending power of consumers in their local markets.

Companies for ‘multidecade growth’

Getting back to Alibaba, the fifth-largest holding of the Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30, Arsta said the company won’t gain more market share as it already dominates online retail in China, “with JD.com JD, -0.53% a distant second.” But he believes that won’t be a problem for Alibaba.

Motley Fool Asset Management Tony Arsta, portfolio manager, Motley Fool Asset Management.

“The purchasing power of the Chinese consumer will continue for multiple decades, and Alibaba is best positioned,” he said, through TMall, the site through which the company sells directly to consumers.

Here are example of companies held by the that Arsta believes have a long runway for increasing sales and profits as emerging-market consumers continue to gain spending power:

MercadoLibre

MercadoLibre MELI, -0.29% based in Argentina, runs popular, localized e-commerce sites throughout Latin America. Like Amazon.com AMZN, +1.49% it sells directly to consumers and also processes transactions by other sellers through its websites. Sellers can also use the company’s MercadoPago system to process point-of-sale transactions.

The company’s stock has had a bumpy ride this year:

FactSet

”MercadoLibre has struggled recently because of investments into their logistics and supply chain,” Arsta said. “They are still serving as a platform to sell other peoples’ goods (similar to Fulfillment by Amazon), but south America does not have a similar infrastructure to that provided in the U.S.”

Arsta reiterated his stance on multidecade investment plays. He believes that with improvements in the ability to deliver products and wider adoption of MercadoPago, MercadoLibre’s long-term thesis is intact.

Safaricom

Safaricom SCOMO, +0.00% is Kenya’s largest telecom-services provider. The shares are only traded locally in Kenya. However, Vodafone Group VOD, -0.61% owns 40% of the company and the Kenyan government owns 35%.

Safaricom also operates a mobile-payment and finance service called M-Pesa, which Arsta called the “dominant” mobile financial system in the country, which “even holds customer deposits.” That is a critical function in a traditionally underbanked economy.

NMC Health

Shares of NMC Health NMC, +0.66% of the United Arab Emirates are traded in London.

The company runs hospitals and provides other health-care services. “There is not too much special about them except for being very good at what they do and being in an area that needs their services,” Arsta said, adding that it has been “a fantastic investment for us.”

Top Glove

Top Glove TOPGLOV, +0.90% TOPGLOV, +0.90% TGLVY, +4.76% is based in Malaysia and is the world’s largest manufacturer of rubber gloves. It was the largest holding of the Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30.

“Statistically, they like to say in their investor presentations that the per-capita consumption of rubber gloves in the U.S. is 150 per year, and for all of Asia it is 11 gloves per year,” Arsta said. Those numbers speak for themselves and imply tremendous potential for growth over a very long period.

“Use in quick-service restaurants, for example, is almost nonexistent in various emerging markets,” Arsta said.

Fund performance and holdings

Here’s how the Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund has performed against its Morningstar category and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index after annual expenses. The fund’s annual expense ratio is currently 1.15% of assets, an amount considered “below average” by Morningstar for its Diversified Emerging Markets category:

Total return - 2018 through Aug. 17 Average annual return - 3 years Average annual return - 5 years Motley Fool Emerging Markets Fund -3.7% 6.9% 3.6% Morningstar Diversified Emerging Markets category -10.5% 2.8% 6.8% MSCI Emerging Markets Index (U.S. Dollars) -4.7% 9.1% 4.1% Sources: Morningstar Direct, FactSet

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-have-misdiagnosed-amazons-push-into-the-pharmacy-business-2018-08-20,"Companies everywhere, in every business, are paranoid about Amazon.com. This sort of paranoia is healthy for the long-term well-being of our investment portfolio, as it is creating interesting buying opportunities.

A case in point: My firm spent a lot of time thinking about pharmacies when we were analyzing investments in McKesson and other drug distributors. We struggled with a question: How will the retail pharmaceutical industry look in the future? Or more precisely, how will Amazon’s entrance into the retail pharmacy business change this industry?

Our inability to answer this question kept us away from retail pharmacies. Then we had a small but important insight that shifted our thinking on Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -0.87% : The preponderance of drugs in the U.S. is consumed by an older population, whose habits change slowly or not at all. Accordingly, it’s likely that Amazon’s AMZN, +1.49% online pharmacy will not significantly impact the existing drug industry.

Here’s why: Americans currently spend $450 billion a year on drugs. Walmart WMT, -0.26% is the fourth-largest pharmacy in the U.S., with sales of $21 billion, or 4.6% of the company’s total sales. Let’s say that over the next five years Amazon gets to Walmart’s sales level of $21 billion. If the U.S. pharmaceutical industry grows 2% a year over that time, total drug sales will have increased by $45 billion, or the equivalent of two Walmarts (we are ignoring compounding here), to $495 billion. Walgreens, with its pharmacy selling about $70 billion a year, would barely notice Amazon’s presence.

I’ve made this point before, but it is important to repeat: 10 years ago Amazon was not taken too seriously. Giants like Google, now Alphabet, GOOG, +0.93% and Microsoft MSFT, +0.85% ignored Amazon’s entry into cloud hosting, thinking “What does a bookseller know about the cloud?” They have regretted it ever since.

Everyone is taking Amazon too seriously

Nowadays everyone is taking Amazon too seriously, bestowing CEO Jeff Bezos with walk-on-water-like superpowers. Boardrooms today are filled to overflowing with chatter about Amazon. There‘s admittedly a lot Corporate America can learn from Bezos (for instance, about ignoring short-term results), but Bezos is not superhuman and Amazon cannot bend the laws of economic gravity.

Walgreens’ U.S. business, which is about 75% of its total sales, is impressive. A single stand-alone store produces revenues of about $10 million a year — $7 million in the pharmacy and $3 million in front-end sales (milk, candy bars, T-shirts, etc.) A single store fills about 121,000 scripts a year (up from 97,000 four years ago). Walgreens has one of the highest sales-per-square-foot numbers in the retail industry, at around $1,000 per-square-foot (compared to Walmart’s $450, Kroger’s KR, -0.63% $550, and Target’s TGT, -0.10% $300). (Note that Tesco’s TSCO, -3.14% U.K. stores have sales per square foot of $1,100 — this is why we like the U.K. grocery business more than ones in the US).

Walgreens also has an underutilized asset: the front end of the store. Think about it: The pharmacy takes up 20% of the floor space but generates 70% of revenue. In other words 80% of the store (the front end) brings in only 30% of revenue. Walgreens is experimenting with different ways to optimize this underutilized asset — it’s opening medical clinics and bringing LabCorp LH, +0.64% into its stores, for instance.

In 2018 Walgreens bought 1,900 stores from Rite Aid RTA, -1.56% , bringing its total U.S. store count up to around 10,000. Store-count growth days are behind Walgreens, but the scripts-per-store-growth will continue, since baby boomers are not getting any younger. Accordingly, total sales growth will continue at a level of at least 2%-3% a year. When retailers mature and cannot open new stores, their free cash flows explode. Which begs the question, what will Walgreens do with its cash?

Already Walgreens is taking a quite different approach than its largest counterpart, CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.65% CVS owns one of the largest pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies (a business that has a lot of political risk, as it’s ridden with conflicts of interest), and CVS is doubling down on complexity and buying Aetna , a health insurance company. CVS is trying to become an integrated healthcare provider. We don’t know if CVS will be successful in this endeavor, but the historical odds of success with acquisitions of this complexity clearly do not favor CVS.

Walgreens is run by Stefano Pessina, who owns 13% of the company; and thus 13 cents of every dollar spent is his. Walgreens has therefore been deleveraging its business, buying back stock, and paying a dividend. Walgreens is expected to earn $6 a share in 2018. My estimate is that earnings, helped by the Rite Aid acquisition, same-store sales growth, and share buybacks (WBA repurchased 8% of its shares in 2018 and has an authorization to buy another 13%), will exceed $8 per share in 2021.

If Walgreens shares trade at 13 times its $8 earnings per share in three years,, then the upside from here is about 70%; if it trades at 15 times then it’s a double (Walmart trades currently at 18 times estimated 2018 earnings, while Target is at 15 times). We bought Walgreens at a little over 10 times estimated 2018 earnings in July 2018. Walgreens is a better business than Target and at least as good a business as Walmart. At this valuation, heads we win, tails we win — the only question is by how much.

So, how does one invest in this overvalued market? Our strategy is spelled out in this fairly lengthy article.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/best-buys-move-into-health-technology-for-the-elderly-is-a-great-strategic-fit-2018-08-16,"Best Buy Co Inc. shares rose Thursday as analysts cheered the news of its acquisition of San Diego-based GreatCall, a health technology company that focuses on the elderly.

The electronics retailer BBY, -0.35% said late Wednesday it is paying $800 million in cash to acquire the company, which provides connected health and emergency response services to more than 900,000 paying subscribers. GreatCall offers mobile products and wearables that connect users to agents who can hook them up with family caregivers or send emergency medical help.

“The health space is a large, growing market where technology can help in particular address the needs of aging consumers, their caregivers, payers and providers,” Best Buy said in a release.

“It gives Best Buy a relevant service, driven by technology, that it can offer to consumers. In our view, it also helps counterbalance the pressure on both sales growth and margins of electronics products.” Neil Saunders, managing director, GlobalData Retail

Analysts said the move was smart, given the challenges facing the retail sector as it grapples with competition from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.51% and changing tastes and shopping habits.

“When you consider that Best Buy is facing the same big box obsolescence threat that many others have lost to Amazon, it’s interesting to see Best Buy shifting their strategy from pure retail, to services and devices,” said Danny Silverman, chief marketing officer at Clavis Insight, an e-commerce analytics company.

See: Best Buy’s online sales have slowed, but should that cause concern?

Best Buy said the deal is part of its Best Buy 2020 strategy that aims to help customers use technology to address key human needs. There are about 50 million Americans today who are older than 65 and the number is expected to grow by more than 50% in the next 20 years amid a demographic shift. That group is widely viewed as underserved by the technology giants.

Also in retail: Walmart stock surge drives up retailers, negates J.C. Penney’s largest-ever plunge

GreatCall has annual revenue of more than $300 million and was owned by private-equity firm GTCR LLC. The deal is expected to close in Best Buy’s fiscal 2019 third quarter and to boost earnings by fiscal 2021.

Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the deal is a “logical evolution.”

“It gives Best Buy a relevant service, driven by technology, that it can offer to consumers. In our view, it also helps counterbalance the pressure on both sales growth and margins of electronics products,” he said.

The focus on health services aimed at the elderly puts Best Buy “squarely into a market with high demand and strong growth. Moreover, we see this as a good fit as Best Buy is a known and trusted brand name among older shoppers. This should enable the company to grow the GreatCall service.”

The aging baby boomer generation is creating new opportunities across the health care sector to address their needs at a scale that was not previously required, said Silverman.

The deal comes at a time when other companies are attempting to enter and shake up the health care space, which continues to be bogged down by high costs and inefficiencies. It comes after Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack as a way to enter the online pharmacy space. It also comes after the health care partnership announced by JP Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.44% , Amazon and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.12% earlier this year.

“They are chasing other retailers, such as CVS CVS, -0.65% who saw this trend years ago when they acquired PBM Caremark in 2007,” said Silverman.

Raymond James analysts said the deal is “a great strategic fit” for Best Buy.

“Potential synergies from the acquisition could be driven by combining GreatCall’s know-how and customer base along with Best Buy’s industry-leading go-to-market adverting, supply chain, and service capabilities, in order to generate leverage off economies of scale,” they wrote in a note.

The assured living market is estimated to be worth about $28 billion and is growing at a roughly 20% pace annually, they wrote.

Raymond James rates Best Buy a strong buy.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/woolworths-annual-profit-rises-boosts-dividend-2018-08-20,"SYDNEY--Australian grocer Woolworths Group Ltd.'s (WOW.AU) annual net profit rose by more than 12% and it boosted dividends, reflecting earnings growth in the Australian food division and benefits from a new petrol alliance.

Net profit in the year through June 24 was about 1.73 billion Australian dollars (US$1.27 billion). Total revenue from continuing operations was A$57.2 billion, up 3.5%. Woolworths said earnings before interest and tax in its key Australian food division rose by nearly 10%.

The company declared a final dividend of 50 Australian cents per share, plus a special dividend of 10 Australian cents. That brought the full-year payout to A$1.03 per share, an increase of 22%, the company said.

Woolworths said Australian food sales in the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year had slowed due to the removal of free single-use plastic bags, the impact of a competitor continuity program and produce and meat deflation. The company said it expects sales momentum to improve over the course of the half year.

The company is ""confident that we have strong plans in place to be 'consistently good' at the fundamentals and drive further shopping differentiation relative to our competitors,"" said Chief Executive Brad Banducci.

The company also said it expected continued progress for its struggling Big W discount-department store chain, with a further reduction in losses this fiscal year. The company added that ""further capital management"" will be considered should it successfully exit its petrol business.

Australia's supermarket sector, long dominated by Woolworths and chief rival Coles, has seen increased competition in recent years from the likes of discount German grocery Aldi. Others could also enter the market in the coming years, including possibly Amazon.com Inc. That's put pressure on Woolworths's sales, but the company has regained some momentum through store refurbishment and staff training.

Woolworths still faces a challenge in turning around its struggling Big W discount department-store chain, and it expected to book a loss on the unit in the recently concluded fiscal year. And its attempt to sell its petrol business to BP PLC fell apart after regulators opposed the deal. Instead, Woolworths entered into a new strategic alliance with Caltex Australia Ltd.

The company recently banned free single-use plastic bags to cut down on waste and is offering sturdier plastic bags to customers for a small fee. Some analysts, however, are worried shoppers won't want to pay for a bag and will instead buy fewer groceries, which could hurt sales in the near future.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-you-should-beware-of-your-smartphoneand-the-invisible-blue-light-it-emits-2018-08-13,"Blue light is everywhere. It’s emitted by computers, televisions and smartphones.

It’s also the cause, in some cases, for accelerated blindness and eye disease, according to a new study. Constantly looking at digital devices kills cells in the eye’s retina, and can lead to macular degeneration, an incurable eye disease that usually begins when people are in their 50s or 60s, a recent University of Toledo study found.

Blue light can cause a “poisonous” chemical reaction in the eye’s photoreceptor cells and, when those cells die, they’re gone forever. The good news: There’s a way to prevent the cells from dying.

Ajith Karunarathne, assistant professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Toledo, found one type of molecule — called the antioxidant alpha tocopherol, which is derived from Vitamin E — can stop the poisonous reaction.

As people get older, it’s harder to fight eye disease. Karunarathne said he hopes this research leads to the invention of preventative measures, such as eye drops to protect the retina.

Blue light in the dark can be especially dangerous, previous studies show, and this type of light has been linked to cancer, diabetes, heart disease and obesity, according to a Harvard University study.

The reason is unclear, but researchers have associated exposure to blue light with a decrease in melatonin, the hormone that affects circadian rhythm — the 24-hour human body clock. When the circadian rhythm is off, so are blood sugar levels, which can lead to obesity and diabetes. Screen time is also associated with depression among adults.

The problems connected with blue light may only get worse. American adults spend more than 11 hours a day looking at screens and check their phones every 10 minutes on average.

Amazon AMZN, +1.51% sells glasses that block the damaging effects of blue light. They cost between $9 and $60. Refrain from looking at digital devices in the hours before bedtime, and expose yourself to bright lights during the day, which affect the way you sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness, the Harvard study found.

And if you’re still constantly looking at a screen, remember to blink regularly. Focusing on a screen decreases reflexes and tear production, which causes dry eyes, according to the College of Optometrists.

In the meantime, try the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, you look 20 feet away for 20 seconds, to give your eyes a break and increase blinking.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-boost-in-internet-sales-help-nordstrom-beat-on-earnings-raise-outlook-2018-08-16,"Nordstrom Inc. shares soared in premarket trade Friday, thanks in part to the retailer’s progress in internet sales, a spot of trouble for primarily brick-and-mortar retailers as Amazon.com Inc. makes more inroads in apparel.

Nordstrom JWN, -2.69% said it earned $162 million, or 95 cents a share, on sales of $4.07 billion in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected earnings of 86 cents a share on sales of $3.97 billion for the three-month period.

Nordstrom stock rallied 7.6% in premarket trade after the earnings beat, which also came complete with a brighter outlook for the year. The shares ended the regular session Thursday up 0.8%.

Nordstrom.com sales rose 50% quarter-on-quarter to $897 million, compared with consensus expectations of $876 million for the quarter, according to FactSet.

Overall digital sales rose by 23% in the second quarter, compared with 20% for the same period last year, Nordstrom said Thursday. Digital sales represented 34% of second-quarter sales, up from 29% a year ago.

What’s more, during the first day of Nordstrom’s anniversary sale in July, the retailer “achieved record digital demand,” surpassing a previous peak by 80%, it said.

Thursday’s second-quarter beat was a respite from a rockier July for the retailer, when Nordstrom shares sank following a 2018 sales guidance that was below consensus.

The beat also came on a day Walmart Inc. shares rallied thanks to a 4.5% jump in second-quarter same-store sales growth, its best in more than 10 years. Walmart, however, reiterated it expects e-commerce losses to be higher this year.

Nordstrom has been beefing up its e-commerce platform, and earlier this month hired a new chief technology officer, Edmond Mesrobian, a year and a half after the departure of the previous CTO.

In March, the company announced deals to buy two retail technology companies, BevyUp and MessageYes, for an undisclosed sum.

Nordstrom stock has gained 10% this year, compared with advances of 6.3% and 3.4%, respectively, for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.05% .",2018-08-16,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/walmart-same-store-sales-grow-at-fastest-pace-in-10-years-as-e-commerce-spending-climbs-2018-08-16,"Walmart Inc. reported same-store sales growth at the strongest levels in more than a decade, offsetting analyst concerns about major investments in areas like e-commerce, where the retail giant expects to have losses for the year.

Walmart WMT, -0.26% U.S. saw same-store sales jump 4.5% during the second quarter, with traffic and ticket growth of more than 2%. Sales of $128.0 billion, beat the FactSet consensus of $126.0 billion.

The results sent Walmart stock soaring 9.3% in Thursday trading.

At the same time, operating income fell to $5.75 billion from $5.97 billion last year, and expenses rose to $26.7 billion from $25.9 billion year-over-year.

“As to e-commerce losses, we mentioned at the start of the year that losses could be somewhat higher than last year and we now expect that to be the case as we continue to invest for the mid-to-long term with continued site enhancement, new tools and technology and Store No8 initiatives while working towards the right balance of assortment and margin,” said Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs in prepared remarks.

See: Walmart stock surge drives up retailers, negates J.C. Penney’s largest-ever plunge

Mark Lore, Walmart’s chief executive officer of e-commerce, also addressed the issue of expenses during a call with the media. While costs are coming down and the retail giant is adding brands to improve the merchandise mix, margins are still not where the company would like them to be.

“It’s taking longer than we had hoped but moving in the right direction,” he said.

Analysts support the investments, with Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail calling the spending “essential” due to the pressure to keep prices low, provide good customer service, keep technology up-to-date, and refurbish stores. Competition with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.51% and any number of other retailers makes the expense worthwhile.

“[A]s painful as they are, the erosion of profitability and margins are necessary evils. Maintaining a price leadership position as well as ensuring the company is an omnichannel leader are clear priorities that require investment,” he wrote.

In the grocery category, where Walmart said it had the best performance in nine years, the company is facing competition from companies like Kroger Co. KR, -0.58% which is investing in enhancements of its own, like driverless delivery.

See: Macy’s may have beat earnings estimates but is still losing market share

“Here we believe that gains are being made [at Walmart] at the expense of other supermarkets, including players like Albertsons which are increasingly losing the battle on price, service and many other fronts,” Saunders said.

Walmart executives say that online grocery is giving that segment of the business a boost, attracting new customers and driving existing customers to add an extra item to their baskets.

E-commerce upgrades from recent months include a revamped website, a new page for baby items, a hot category, and a 3-D feature for online home shopping. Lore and other executives also talked up the launch of JetBlack, a New York City shopping service that mixes e-commerce and the personal shopping experience.

E-commerce growth was 40% for the quarter and the company expects growth to be 40% for the year. Earlier this year, e-commerce growth slowed, driving down the stock.

“We believe Walmart is fiercely holding its own in the competition vs. Amazon which is highly relevant given that 86% of Walmart shoppers also shop at Amazon, based on Cowen research,” wrote Cowen & Co. analysts led by Oliver Chen in a Thursday note.

Cowen rates Walmart shares at outperform with a $105 price target.

“We believe recent comp growth results indicate Walmart’s investment in price and associates is working, resulting in improved traffic trends and store productivity,” Stifel analysts wrote in a note. “We maintain our hold rating, though we believe Walmart’s continued comp growth and strong e-commerce results better position it to compete against online competitors compared to retailer peers.”

Stifel has an $87 price target on Walmart stock.

Penney Co. Inc. shares.

The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -1.18% gained 0.3%, paring earlier gains of as much as 1.1%. The bounce follows a 2.7% decline on Wednesday, in which disappointing results from Macy’s Inc. M, -2.83% prompted a pullback from Tuesday’s record close.

Walmart’s stock WMT, -0.26% soared 9.3% to close at a six-month high on volume of 42.6 million shares, to pace the retail ETF’s gainers, after the discount retail giant reported fiscal second-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales that beat expectations, and raised its full-year outlook.

The price gain of $8.42 added about 57 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s DJIA, -0.05% price, which ran up 396 points. See Market Snapshot.

“Combine store bricks and digital clicks; it’s working,” wrote analyst Oliver Chen at Cowen in a note to clients, as he reiterated his outperform rating and $105 stock price target.

Walmart’s fortunes were in stark contrast to J.C. Penney’s JCP, -1.69% hardships, as the department store chain’s stock plummeted 27% to a record closing low, after the struggling retailer reported a wider-than-expected loss and slashed its outlook. That exceeded the previous biggest percentage selloff of 19.7% on May 16, 2012.

The stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange, as volume of 83.8 million shares was nearly six-times the full-day average.

Among other more active retailer stocks, Macy’s Inc.’s M, -2.83% which dragged the sector lower on Wednesday with its 16% tumble, bounced 1.9%.

Elsewhere, shares of Rite Aid Corp. RAD, -1.74% climbed 4.4%, Target Corp. TGT, -0.06% rose 1.7%, Kroger Co. KR, -0.58% advanced 1.6%, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -0.87% added 1.3% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.51% edged up 0.2%.

The resumed retail-sector rally comes on the heels of data showing retail sales increased 0.5% in July, well above expectations of 0.1% growth, amid strong showings by internet retailers, department store chains and clothing stores.

“Details of the report suggest broad-based gains across most product categories except a few pockets of softness,” wrote Nomura’s chief U.S. economist, Lewis Alexander, in an Instinet research note. “Overall, the report suggests continued momentum in personal spending in Q3 after a transitory slowdown in end-Q2.”

U.S. stocks rallied to close higher Thursday, with the Dow having its best day in four months, on strong corporate earnings from Walmart Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. News that the U.S. and China are prepared to resume trade talks next week also bolstered investors’ sentiment.

How did the benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.05% jumped 396.32 points, or 1.6%, to 25,558.73. It was the blue-chip index’s strongest one-day performance since April 10, when it surged 429 points, or 1.8%, according to FactSet data.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12% advanced 22.32 points, or 0.8%, to 2,840.69 with all its 11 sectors ending in positive territory, led by telecommunications services, consumer staples and financials. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% added 32.41 points, or 0.4%, to 7,806.52.

Major indexes fell sharply Wednesday, though they ended off their lows of the session. The Dow closed at its lowest level since July 23, and both the Dow and the S&P 500 had dropped in five of the previous six sessions. The Nasdaq had declined in three of the past four trading days.

What drove the market?

In a potentially positive development, China will send a delegation to the U.S. later this month to resume trade talks, the first such meeting since July. The news comes at a period of elevated tensions between the two major trading partners who have been imposing tariffs on billions of dollars on each other’s goods over the past several months. The prospect of a trade war has intermittently pressured equities in recent months.

Opinion: Trump is right: America was ‘built on tariffs’

Aside from elevated trade tensions, the market has been battered by the economic crisis in Turkey, which investors fear could spread to other regions or hurt European banks, many of which have exposure to the country.

The currency problem will likely continue to dictate market action in the short term, but there are signs that the situation has stabilized. On Wednesday, it was reported that Qatar would invest $15 billion in Turkey, which could provide something of a lifeline.

The Turkish lira TRYUSD, -2.4507% was on track for its third straight session with a pronounced gain against the dollar, fueling hopes that the recent all-time low represented a bottom. The lira gained about 3% on the dollar Thursday, bringing its week-to-date rise against the greenback to more than 10%. However, it is still down more than 15% thus far in August.

In the latest data, initial jobless claims fell more than expected in the latest week, nearing postrecession lows.

The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index sank to a 21-month low of 11.9 in August, a reading that was below analyst expectations.

Construction of new houses increased by less than 1% in July, reflecting a recent slowdown in building that is likely tied to higher mortgage rates and growing shortages of skilled craftsmen.

What were market analysts saying?

“Stocks reacted much more significantly to reported results this quarter than in the first quarter,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA.

“Second-quarter earnings growth of 24.8% was the best since 2004 — excluding the postrecession rebound in 2010. The results pushed the S&P 500 1.5% higher since July 12, the day before JPMorgan kicked-off earnings season,” she said. “Underlying strength in corporate profitability and economic data should bode well for the market long-term. But near-term, as the risks become more of a focus, fundamental news will likely take a back seat and the market may struggle in a period that has been historically weak seasonally.”

Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Cornerstone Wealth, believes Thursday’s upside momentum is sustainable, given the strength of consumer demand highlighted by Walmart results. But he also expects politics will help to yield results on the trade front.

“Some announcements on trade, whether it’s with Nafta, the EU and China or all of the above, can be catalysts for the next leg higher. We’ve heard about progress made on all fronts, and murmurs out of China that higher-ups are not happy with President Xi’s hardline tactics bode well for renegotiated agreements. With midterms on the horizon, the administration will want some wins on trade to bolster chances that the Republicans keep both chambers,” Hodge said in a note.

“Earnings out of Walmart are very positive for the market as it is a reflection not just of Walmart’s online growth but it offers a positive snapshot of the U.S. consumer,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.

What stocks were in focus?

Walmart WMT, -0.26% surged 9.3% after it reported adjusted second-quarter earnings that topped expectations, along with revenue that was above consensus expectations. The discount retailer also boosted its adjusted 2019 earnings forecast.

Bloomberg said late Wednesday that Amazon is currently in the running, along with some other suitors, to acquire Landmark from Wagner/Cuban Cos. Landmark’s owners are working with investment banker Stephens Inc. on a possible sale, Bloomberg reported, though no final decisions have yet been made.

Amazon already has a film studio, TV studio and music service, and acquiring Landmark would give the company a chain of more than 50 theaters with 252 screens in 27 markets. The theater chain was founded in 1974 and focuses on independent and foreign films.

Such an acquisition would be a significant move in Amazon’s recent push into the physical space, and would give the company another avenue to distribute its films. The online retailer acquired Whole Foods last year for $13.7 billion and now offers its Prime members discounts at the organic-food chain.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/walmart-sales-rise-the-most-in-more-than-10-years-2018-08-16,"Walmart Inc. said sales rose at the fastest rate in over a decade as the world's largest retailer continues to draw more people to stores and benefit from strong consumer spending boosting performance at many retailers.

Sales at existing U.S. stores and websites rose 4.5% during the second quarter ended July 31. Walmart also said it expects sales and profit to rise more than previously expected during the current fiscal year. Sales in existing U.S. stores will rise 3%, the retailer said.

Buoyed by rising wages and employment, plus a tax cut, all of which have translated into disposable-income gains, consumers are spending again with more abandon than they have in years.

Other retailers including Home Depot Inc. and Macy's Inc. said earlier this week sales rose in the second quarter. Home Depot raised its earnings and sales targets for the year due to rising home-improvement purchases and a strong U.S. economy.

Walmart shares have fallen over 8% so far this year, dropping most precipitously since February when the retailer reported a slowdown in ecommerce sales growth during the fourth quarter. Shares surged 10% in premarket trading to $99.61.

Walmart said its quarterly U.S. ecommerce sales picked up compared with earlier this year, rising 40% versus the same quarter last year, up from 33% during the first quarter and in line with the retailer's expectations.

""Customers tell us that they feel better about the current health of the U.S. economy as well as their personal finances,"" said Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon in an earnings release. ""They're more confident about their employment opportunities.""

Walmart said fresh-food sales were particularly strong, while warm weather helped spur purchases of lawn, garden and pool products along with clothing.

That corresponds with trends reported by other retailers, as well as industry-wide trends. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that July retail sales -- a measure of spending at U.S. stores, websites and restaurants -- rose 6.4% compared with the previous year.

Walmart, which booked $128 billion in total quarterly sales, has invested heavily in recent years to grow sales online around the globe to fend off Amazon.com Inc. That has helped the chain rise above the sales slump suffered by other brick-and-mortar retailers facing new consumer buying behavior. This quarter marked over three years of quarterly sales growth for Walmart.

But the retailer continues to invest heavily online and to lower product prices versus competitors, while facing rising commodity and transportation costs. In the second quarter operating income fell 3.7% to $5.8 billion.

Walmart is leaning on the profits of U.S. stores to grow online, said Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs in an earnings release. The company expects ecommerce loses this year to be higher than last, he said.

Walmart said its per-share earnings for the full year would hit $4.90 to $5.05, up from a previously expected range of $4.75 to $5. Walmart reiterated that its planned investment in Indian ecommerce company Flipkart would reduce full-year per-share earnings by 25 cents to 30 cents.

The Fly over at iBankCoin is overstating things in his trademark way, as he declares that stock futures skyrocketed because China is coming over to negotiate out of a trade war. But, true enough, there is quite a bit of green on screens at the moment.

“The market held 2,800 support, and traders are not scrambling for the exits,” Ziedins writes.

What about all of this week’s Turkey news?

“I don’t believe these headlines pose a material risk to our markets and even Europe’s economic health,” the Colorado-based trader and writer says. A bounce looks “inevitable.”

The S&P could slip further over the next few days, making any buying now feel like it came too soon, Ziedins concedes. But overall, he’s seeing “a pretty attractive entry point.”

“I cannot predict the bottom, but I know the risk/reward shifted our direction,” he says.

Disagree? Financial blogger Pretzel Logic is with you, warning that the “bears appear to have the ball now.”

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/28/2018/best-buy-pullback-earnings-buying-opportunity,"Best Buy: Is the Pullback on Earnings a Buying Opportunity?

I recently previewed what to expect from Best Buy (BBY) leading up to its July-quarter earnings announcement. My general assertion is that the Minneapolis-based consumer electronics and appliance retailer has positioned itself well in terms of recovering from retail fallout, along with expansion into new markets through acquisitions.

However, Tuesday morning's second-quarter results failed to impress investors. The stock is down despite comp store sales growth that outperformed estimates. Much of the ire seems to be stemming from lower guidance for the third quarter, despite the fact that full-year guidance was actually increased.

Last time I wrote on Best Buy, I suggested that underwhelming results and a subsequent pullback could lead to a buying opportunity. Is this that opportunity?

What's Not to Like?

I couldn't be more pleased with the second-quarter results. The company's total revenues increased 4.9% to $9.38 billion. Domestic revenue was up 4.4% to $8.64 billion, with online revenues growing 10.1% to $1.21 billion. Online sales now represent 14% of the company's domestic business.

This is slower overall online growth than the company has posted in the past. Whether that is a cause for concern is up for debate, though.

Personally, I think there's an equilibrium between brick and mortar/online sales that the market hasn't found yet. Moving past my view that e-commerce is destroying American labor markets, when it comes to Best Buy's earnings, as long as sales go up, I don't really care where they came from.

A critique that could be made is the lower gross profit rate of 23.8%, versus 24.0% a year earlier. The company cited higher supply chain expenses as well as the cost associated with rolling out its revamped tech support offerings.

Internationally, BBY is creating solid growth rates. International revenue advanced 10.8% to $740 million. Though one should note international gross profit rates did slide to 23.1% versus 25.1%. Again, there were high expenses incurred.

Gross profit rates certainly didn't affect the company's ability to increase income. Operating income rose 4.3%, year to year, to $335 million, and a lower overall tax rate helped drive net earnings to $244 million; a 16.7% increase from a year earlier. That income, combined with share reductions, allowed for GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.86. That's a 28.4% improvement.

It's hard to be mad about those numbers. And yet, the market is pulling BBY stock down.

Too Much Enthusiasm

It appears people had a real problem with the slower online sales growth, as they use Amazon (AMZN) as a barometer for everything these days. Furthermore, the stock ran hard in the past month as momentum and enthusiasm increased for the retailer's strong turnaround. Perhaps there was a little too much enthusiasm, similar to when Macy's (M) reported earnings earlier this month.

Macy's also pulled back off news that its quarterly results weren't literally divine. There's a big difference here, though. Macy's reported relatively flat overall sales. Best Buy reported a comparable sales increase of 6.2%, a higher growth rate than last year's 5.4%. Furthermore, the company raised its full-year guidance.

Non-GAAP fiscal year 2019 earnings are now expected to be $4.95 to $5.10 per diluted share. Let's say they hit $5.00 per share. That would mean the stock is currently trading around 15.48x forward non-GAAP earnings estimates. That's not an absurd valuation for a company that's delivering solid growth.

How I'm Playing the Stock

This might require patience. The market is freaking out over the company's lower expected performance in the third quarter -- at least relative to analyst estimates (those pesky analysts).

If Wall Street does in fact give Best Buy the cold shoulder through the third quarter because of lower guidance of $0.79 to $0.84, I think some big value could open up.

It will pay to watch how this one performs. If Best Buy shares slip through the third quarter, I think BBY is a great stock to buy and ride. Let's remember, Best Buy has a history of beating estimates overall. The company could very well give us a surprise in the third quarter. I wouldn't necessarily bet on that, but it's food for thought.

I think this one will be all about that fourth quarter. The holiday season will be the next catalyst to make or break these retailers.

If the shares do fall more, I'm definitely considering taking a stake. It will be a matter of if the economy can stay strong, and fuel prices can remain tolerable. If that equation stays positive, retail should remain strong.

GreatCall Acquisition

As an added bonus, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Best Buy's $800 million acquisition of GreatCall will provide the company exposure to an aging American consumer market in a big way. The confluence of tech and convenience, GreatCall's $300 million in annual revenues stem over 900,000 paying subscriptions for its product offerings.

If Best Buy can tap into that consumer base, and creatively implement ties to its current business, I think there's huge potential here. The company's tech squad workers can make house calls for tech problems. Increased utilization of GreatCall's jitterbug smartphone, coupled with its emergency connectivity products, make it a huge revenue area if Best Buy can tap into that senior citizen market.

This is a great long-term story for the company.",,
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/2-ways-to-trade-amd-on-amazing-run-higher-14695326,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is having a crazy run higher. And this elite runner shows no signs of slowing.

Like most of kids my generation, I played a lot of sports growing up -- and kept doing so right through my mid-20s. Then it became difficult to find time for oneself, with responsibilities such as raising children and the support required by that family. Hence, like for many of us, that was the end of participation in any team sports that come with any kind of set schedule. About the only thing a young dad or mom can do, sometimes, is run. Not on a time hack. Starting and ending at one's home. The only enemy would be fatigue. All working folks who run, run with fatigue.

So, I ran. Many decades later, I still do. Just slower. The equity marketplace has a runner these days, too. A championship caliber runner. Yesterday, Cemex (CX) and iQiyi (IQ) ran with this big dog for a day. Since mid-August, Action Alerts PLUS holding Nvidia (NVDA) has spiked side by side with this elite runner. But this runner has been going hard since early April, only pausing to consolidate gains over June and July.

Elite Runner

This new champion seems like a beast. The new champ is Advanced Micro Devices, and is led by industry superstar CEO Lisa Su. I can't complain. No, I don't have an equity stake. I have been short put options throughout, though. In fact, I am short put options right now. That provides revenue, but not what the equity provides for shareholders when a name goes semi-parabolic like this. Let's take a look.

The Buzz

Over the weekend, AMD introduced the firm's high-end Radeon Pro V340 graphics card at the VMware (VMW) conference in Las Vegas. That, at least, is the most recent news. AMD popped on Monday, closing at $25.26, an increase of 5.3% after trading as high as $27.30 mid-session. Monday's closing bell closed the book on the stock's seventh consecutive day of gains. It's not just this news however. This name is 57% higher since putting better than expected second-quarter data to the tape on July 25.

Here is what Su just told TheStreet.

For the year, AMD is up... wait for it ... 146%. And that is after being down for the year when that early-April turn was made. All the while, Lisa Su was slowly setting the firm up to take market share away from Nvidia in graphics, and another of my names, Intel (INTC) when it comes to CPUs for personal computers and processors.

Could Have Had a V8

Simply put, as a long-term Intel guy, I want Intel to hire Lisa Su. Short of that happening, I want in. As you all know by now, I don't chase. Let's look at short interest. As of two weeks ago, more than 20% of the firm's entire float was still held in short positions, totaling more than 146 million shares. Guaranteed that number is down from there, as yesterday's top sure looked like a squeeze to this old dog.

By the way, according to MarketWatch, AMD is the third least profitable (or worst performing) aggregate short position of 2018 in terms of dollars lost, only behind FANG names Amazon (AMZN) , and Netflix (NFLX) at this point. Amazon is an Action Alerts PLUS holding.

Let's go back to those Q2 numbers reported on July 25. That quarter, in addition to beating expectations for both the top and bottom lines, showed significant year-over-year improvement almost everywhere. Net sales, EBITDA, cash on hand, profit margins, return on assets, interest coverage.. all up big. Know what was down? Total debt, and debt-to-capital ratio. Big swing and a miss there, Sarge. I could have had a V8.

Play This Sport

Okay, this horse runs with a beta of 1.6. That means that technically, we are going to get a selloff. I keep telling myself that. Three-year sales growth is hot at a rate of 14%. Current and quick ratios are fine. Cash flow is solid. Third-quarter earnings are due October 22. Let's go to the chart.

See the Pitchfork? No way that trajectory holds, or at least I'm not buying the name at the top of a model like that. Daily MACD? reminds me of Crazy Eddie. The Fibonacci Fan as laid out gives us something, at least that is if the remaining shorts have enough gas in the tank elsewhere to not end up being forced into action.

With a naked equity position out of the question at these levels, at least for me, I've got to figure something else out.

Trade #1: What I'll Likely Do (minimal lots)

Sell (write) one October 19 $21 put option (Last: $0.53)

Sell (write) one January 2019 $19 put option (last $0.79)

Note: I have been shorting AMD puts all along, without ending up having to buy the shares. It is important that the investor not only be willing to buy the shares, but actually want to own the shares on a dip, which is the fact in my case. If I end up never eating these shares, at least I drag in some revenue with the stock's upward movement. Better than being a wallflower at the school dance.

Trade #2: What An Investor Could Do (minimal lots)

NAFTA or Half-TA

It has been a volatile year and a half. On Monday, a trade deal was finally struck between the U.S. and Mexico, as the sands of time slowly run out on the Enrique Pena Nieto presidency. Nieto was not constitutionally eligible to run for re-election. President-Elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be inaugurated this December 1. Both Mexican presidents apparently had a hand in putting this agreement together.

Among the most obvious changes would be those made in the production of automobiles. The first would be that steel and aluminum must be sourced in North America. The second would be the push for higher wages, as between 40% to 45% of auto content would have to be produced by workers that earn at least $16 per hour. These two items are extremely pro-labor from a U.S. point of view, as this would require either higher wages for Mexican workers or would shift more production north of the border. President Trump has long targeted increased operational capacity for U.S. steel producers. Another plus for organized labor.

Agricultural goods will get a pass on tariffs in this deal, as they had in the older version of NAFTA. It was a good day for U.S. farmers, as separately, the Trump administration pledged $4.7 billion to help soften the impact from losses experienced due to the nation's current trade policies.

From a technology perspective, intellectual property copyright holders will maintain full protection. This item will be key as the U.S. administration looks to build upon this agreement and resume talks at some point with China. September 5 is next week. In addition, trade executed through digital distribution will be exempt from cross-border tariffs, as this means of commerce was still futuristic when the original version of NAFTA was drafted.

Sunrise, Sunset

Perhaps the biggest sticking point from the American side has been the insistence of a sunset clause -- or in other words, a way out if labor conditions or currency valuations end up hurting one nation significantly more than the other with the passage of time. The U.S. had been angling for a five-year window, and that demand had been met with stiff resistance over the past year. The deal agreed to yesterday is a 16-year agreement, with a built-in provision for a six-year review that seems to have been enough to satisfy both Presidents Trump and Nieto.

The question now becomes, where does this leave Canada? What is clear is that both the U.S. and Mexico would like to add Canada to this agreement in order to make this Half-TA deal a true NAFTA deal. It would appear that unless Canada is able to agree to conditions now agreed upon between the U.S. and Mexico, the Canadian position just became that much more difficult.

https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/microsoft-s-new-xbox-service-could-pave-the-way-for-bigger-things-14694508,"Microsoft's (MSFT) new Xbox All Access promotion might just be the first step towards a bigger overhaul of the company's gaming business model.

Xbox All Access, officially unveiled on Monday morning, works much like traditional phone subsidy plans from mobile carriers. A user is given an Xbox console in exchange for a 2-year commitment to the service, which comes with the Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass services. After those two years are up, the user gets to keep the console, and can choose whether to keep subscribing to Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass.

A version of the service that comes with an Xbox One S console -- it supports 4K video playback, but not 4K gaming -- and sports a 1TB hard drive costs $22 per month, or $528 over two years. A version that comes with a 1TB Xbox One X, which packs a more powerful AMD (AMD) processor and supports 4K gaming, costs $35 per month, or $840 over two years.

Notably, Microsoft says Xbox All Access is only available ""for a limited time."" Moreover, consumers can only sign up for the service at a bricks-and-mortar Microsoft Store (here's a list of them, for those curious).

For someone who's in the market for a game console, doesn't need 4K gaming support and lives close to a Microsoft Store, the One S version of All Access might be worth a look. 1TB Xbox One S console bundles -- they come with one or more popular games -- go for $299, while the Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass services respectively cost $120 and $240 over two years, assuming one pays for Live Gold via the $60 annual plan.

Thus the One S All Access plan yields a 20% discount to individually buying a One S console bundle and signing up for Live Gold and Game Pass. The One X plan isn't as much of a bargain: With One X console bundles going for $499, the plan provides just a $19 (2%) discount relative to paying for everything piecemeal...and without a 2-year contract. However, for those whom the One X's up-front price represents a major expense, the plan could have some appeal.

Still, it's best to keep expectations in check. In addition to the fact that users can only sign up ""for a limited time"" at a Microsoft Store, the fact that the current console cycle is now nearly five years old -- both the original Xbox One and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 were launched in the fall of 2013 -- is likely to keep a lid on All Access sign-ups. Lifetime PS4 sales have topped 80 million, and (while Microsoft no longer shares Xbox sales figures) research firm IHS Markit has estimated lifetime Xbox One sales were at 39.1 million as of March.

Also: While One S and One X bundles respectively go for $299 and $499, the consoles are cheaper on a standalone basis. A standalone One S featuring a 500GB hard drive costs just $230 at Microsoft's online and physical stores. Walmart (WMT) charges $465 for a standalone 1TB One X.

Chances are that most PS4 users who have built up a substantial library of PS4 games are unlikely to be interested in All Access. And among consumers who have previously bought an Xbox One, interest could be limited outside of those who have a faulty console and/or want to upgrade to a 4K-capable system.

However, considering what Microsoft's gaming unit has in its pipeline, All Access could very well pave the way for more popular and widely-available subscription plans that feature bundled hardware.

During June's E3 gaming conference, Microsoft confirmed it plans to launch a new gaming service that -- unlike Game Pass, which works only on Xboxes and relies on game downloads -- will rely on cloud-based streaming and work across Xboxes, PCs and phones. And multiple reports have indicated Microsoft will refresh the Xbox in 2020. Some reports indicate that two Xboxes will launch: A traditional high-performance console and a cheaper device focused on game and video streaming.

If Microsoft's next-gen Xbox launches are accompanied by the launch of All Access plans that provide one of the new consoles plus access to Xbox Live Gold and the game-streaming service, and should Microsoft let users sign up online rather than only through its physical stores, those plans could be quite popular with gamers looking to obtain a next-gen console. That could include, potentially, some PS4 owners.

In addition, if Microsoft does indeed launch a cheap streaming-focused Xbox, it could price an All Access plan that bundles the cheaper Xbox at less than $20 per month, if not around $15 per month. While gaming enthusiasts are more likely to prefer a plan featuring a traditional console that can run demanding games locally, plans featuring the cheaper Xbox and the game-streaming service could be popular with more casual gamers, including some who don't yet own a console.

A general trend among consumers (particularly younger ones) to swap traditional physical goods purchases with subscription services would also work in Microsoft's favor here. Likewise, the accelerating pace of console launches -- driven in part by the pace of innovation in the PC gaming industry -- might increase the appeal of services that let users upgrade to a new box every two years or so.

Sony and Microsoft launched 4K gaming-capable consoles just 3 and 4 years, respectively, after launching the original PS4 and Xbox One. And if the rumor mill is right, Microsoft's next-gen Xbox will launch just 3 years after the One X. As Nvidia (NVDA) and others in the PC gaming ecosystem keep pushing the envelope regrading what PCs containing high-end GPUs can do, console makers have a strong incentive to refresh their hardware more frequently. And -- in what's a positive for AMD -- console gamers seeking cutting-edge local gaming experiences have an incentive to upgrade their hardware more often.

Microsoft has made no secret of the fact that it's revamping its gaming strategy to place less of an emphasis on traditional Xbox sales and game royalties, and more of one on subscription services and cross-platform experiences. In that context, the software giant's current All Access promotion could serve as a trial balloon of sorts, ahead of product and service launches that between them are capable of both dramatically changing Microsoft's gaming revenue mix and expanding its addressable market.

No, FANG didn't do it. No, FANG isn't powering this market higher.

But FANG isn't dead either.

Take a look at the S&P 500, which gained 0.8% Monday.

FB) AMZN) NFLX) GOOGL) Now look at Facebook , up 1.6%, Amazon, up 1.17%, Netflixup 1.6% and Alphabet/Googlewhich increased 1.5%.

That does not make them leaders.



But it doesn't make them laggards either.

I think that the key takeaway of the move is that Facebook is no longer an anchor to leeward. Something is happening in the valuation of Facebook that is making people think twice about selling it. I think that it belongs in the $180s but I would love to trim it for the trust then.

Today was an industrial and financial rally . In fact, the only tech that did well were semis that I regard as Internet of Things auto plays.

GS) MS) It was much more of a Goldman Sachs/Morgan Stanleyand auto day. They were the leaders.

But FANG is back, there is no doubt about it. We can't write it off as that was literally less than 10 days ago.

I think that analysts will find reasons to bolster the FANG names in the next few days. They haven't had much to crow about.

So stay long. Don't sell. And in the case of FB , dare I say, maybe you even buy. As I have told Action Alerts PLUS members, we no longer think it is a sell as we have a 2 rating, but it is tempting in the low $170s to make it a 1.",,Netflix
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/27/2018/facebook-analysts-are-still-bullish-instagram-whatsapp-growth-opportunities,"Facebook Analysts Are Still Bullish on Instagram, WhatsApp Growth Opportunities

Despite regulatory pressure and growth challenges, Facebook, Inc. (FB) analysts and investors are still optimistic about the company's secondary businesses outside its core product.

WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger products are emerging as new engines of growth, if the company succeeds in expediting monetization efforts across platforms.

Gaining 1.7% , the stock is down about $6 year to date and $42 from its close just before its second quarter earnings fallout. The company has seen a nearly 20% decline in its share price from its July highs, as political pressures, decelerated guidance figures, and concerns user growth slowdowns mount.

Still, analysts are not ready to relinquish their buy rating for the company as its numerous platforms offer opportunities independently from the core product.

""They still have a number of platforms that are not fully monetized and have massive user populations,"" Kevin Rottinghaus, president and lead analyst at Edgewater Research, told Real Money in an interview this morning. ""Those are the real opportunities that can help the company continue to grow.""

He pointed specifically to WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook Groups as areas that are not currently monetized to their full potential, all of which have drawn attention from company executives as areas of planned growth.

""The ads have expanded quite nicely to Instagram, and Instagram represents a very healthy part of the growth and we expect that to continue as well,"" COO Sheryl Sandberg told analysts during an earnings presentation last month, explaining growth engines for the second half of the year.

Sandberg also noted the billions of users on the messenger platform, offering another massive population available for targeted advertising. However, she clarified that the process of monetization will be ""very slow and deliberate.""

""Instagram is doing a good job at attracting younger users,"" Rottinghaus added, noting that the photo sharing platform is likely to buoy future growth even if Facebook's core platform comes under added siege from regulators and user slowdown.

As a result of these remaining opportunities and company vision, Rottinghaus affirmed a buy rating for the stock.

The upside potential of these secondary platforms was also emphasized by Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus team on Friday in their Weekly Roundup feature.

""We continue to hold here because of the advertiser reliance of the platform and the future monetization, revenue boosting opportunities in WhatsApp and Messenger,"" the team wrote.

Rottinghaus remained cautious on his own rating however, citing future issues on data protection and censorship on hate speech as significant stories in the company's future across all of its platforms.

""We definitely think some more changes and cautious news are ahead of them,"" he said. ""[Regulation] is clearly a major issue for the long-term health of the platform.""

He said he approved of actions thus far to make its social media entities as user friendly as possible, but sounded his concern on the size of the project to ""clean up"" the platforms will be, noting the scale of the media space the company now has to police.

Regulation on both speech and data privacy is not going away, given recent EU commission statements on its intention to crack down on the platform for its data misgivings and UN criticism for its lack of policing on hate speech, specifically with regard to the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar.

As issues on data privacy and hate speech continue to heat up for the core platform and begin to pressure advertising revenue, the secondary platforms that the media giant controls might well offer Facebook and its shareholders a much-needed growth engine.

The company is also leveraging its AI capabilities to manage growth across secondary platforms.

""We're using AI systems in our global community operations team to fight spam, harassment, hate speech, and terrorism across all of our apps to keep people safe,"" Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call. ""And this incredibly useful for apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, as it helps us manage the challenges of hyper-growth there more effectively.""",,Facebook

In Beating the Street, billionaire Peter Lynch offers some sage advice to investors: ""Stick with a steady and consistent performer.""

What are the best performers today on Wall Street? To answer that question, we turned to TipRanks' Trending Stocks investor tool. We scoped three stocks that have sparked analyst buzz over the last 30 days.

The common denominators: (1) top analysts are loving names in tech; (2) each pick is a 'Strong Buy' and (3) these three stocks have soared on back of earnings season.

Microsoft

Software giant Microsoft (MSFT) had a slam dunk fourth fiscal quarter earnings report. Microsoft posted a monster $110 billion in annual revenue. Ever since releasing the print on Jul. 19 -- complete with stellar revenue outlook -- shares of Microsoft have floated on a 4% upturn.

Microsoft is a key holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS.

Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI reiterated an Outperform rating on Microsoft on the heels of the print. Materne believes Microsoft's stock can hit $120, another almost 11% room to fly.

Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth echoes Materne's bullish confidence. Notably, Feinseth is a top analyst on Wall Street- #134 out of over 4,800 analysts we track on TipRanks.

Worthy of note, Feinseth upgraded Microsoft and joined the bulls in January 2017, and has stayed bullish ever since. Feinseth has carved out a good track record on recommending Microsoft, realizing 28.6% in average profits.

Feinseth reiterates a Buy rating on Microsoft's stock for (1) strong, sustained revenue growth, and (2) greater profit driven by strong product performance across all key business lines.

Specifically, the analyst sees business ramping up thanks to a rising user base of ""market-leading applications,"" Office 365 and Azure. Azure is Microsoft's heavy-hitter of ""growth and profitability.""

Other key advantages: LinkedIn, which is a solid contributor to the tech giant's ""ongoing growth and success;"" innovation and savvy M&A moves to expand ""gaming industry dominance;"" and a robust balance sheet and cash flow.

Ultimately, the 'Strong Buy' stock has attracted a big bullish camp on Wall Street. Microsoft has attracted 23 buy recommendations over the last three months. The 12-month average price target of $120.48 reflects upbeat analyst expectations. Bottom line, best-performing analysts forecast 11% in upside potential still in store for the giant.

Splunk

Enterprise software player Splunk (SPLK) made a killing in its latest round of tech earnings. Splunk's quarterly results on August 23 trounced Street-wide expectations and sent shares jumping almost 15%. Sitting at a market cap of nearly $18 billion, it's clear to see that analysts are loving this tech name.

One is a top performing analyst, Piper Jaffray's Alex Zukin, ranked #33 on Wall Street. The analyst released a post-earnings research note with an enthusiastic title: ""F2Q19 Earnings: R.E.S.P.E.C.T.""

Thanks to standout sales execution, Zukin reiterates an overweight rating and hikes the price target from $130 to $135. To put it simply, even though Splunk's stock just soared, Zukin believes another 9% in upside is on the horizon. This was a ""very strong"" quarter for Splunk and Zukin does not see the fundamentals changing any time soon.

Overall, the 'Strong Buy' stock has attracted a big bullish camp on Wall Street. In the last three months, 17 analysts have rated a Buy on Splunk's stock. Moreover, consensus expectations also suggest confidence. The 12-month average price target of $133.00 reflects nearly 8% in upside potential ahead.

Zendesk

Danish customer service software company based in San Francisco Zendesk (ZEN) unleashed robust second quarter showcase on July 31. Investors clearly took notice, sending the stock on a 12%. How does this measure up against the word on the Street?

Already ahead of the print, five-star analyst Marshall Senk of Rosenblatt had gotten more confident on the tech stock. The analyst was so bullish approaching Zendesk's earnings that he not only reiterated a Buy but he also boosted his price target from $59 to $70. Senk calls for 5% in upside potential for Zendesk shares.

Senk boasts an impressive track record when rating Zendesk's stock: a cool 75.1% in average returns. Clearly, Senk's bullish bets are seeing a big pay-off on Wall Street.

Research suggests a positive ramp-up in Zen's enterprise business. Senk highlighted: ""As we saw in the first quarter, our research points to continued acceleration in the enterprise market, with partners reporting they are seeing an increasing number of larger multi product opportunities, driven by improved messaging (and partner training), strong interest in Chat, Guide and Answer BOT and ease of implementation relative to the competition.""

Between this momentum and conviction that Zendesk can keep it going throughout 2018, Senk is all the more upbeat on the tech player's prospects.

This software player stands as a 'Strong Buy' name among best-performing analysts. In the last three months, Zen has won eight bullish recommendations. With a return potential of close to 5%, the stock's consensus price target lands at $69.94.",2018-08-27,
https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-back-to-school-shopping-as-a-way-to-teach-your-kids-about-budgeting-14693015,"As Labor Day approaches, another summer is coming to an end.

While millions of parents across America eagerly anticipate one last barbecue, they should also start thinking about the inevitable back-to-school shopping that accompanies dwindling August days. For those seeking ways to get their kids more engaged in the process, back-to-school shopping presents a great opportunity to teach them the principles of financial responsibility.

Here are a few tips for parents to get started.

Compare Costs

Before hitting the stores, sit down with your child and review their back-to-school shopping list together. From there, explore an online vendor like Amazon (AMZN) or Staples and fill a virtual cart with all the required items so your child can learn about individual costs and see how quickly these can add up to an unexpectedly large sum. Then, rather than buying the supplies online, bring your child and the list to a physical store so they can go through the process and check off items as you go. You can make this into a fun game of trying to beat the total online price by taking advantage of sales, shopping on a tax-free holiday or visiting various stores.

With older kids, parents can employ a similar strategy but offer a bit more independence.

Suggest your kids go through the process primarily on their own after you provide some financially savvy guidance. For example, recommend they compare prices among similar items on their smartphone as a way to research competitor pricing while at another store. For big-ticket purchases like a laptop computer, remind them it's important to evaluate options within a store and between brands, as well as leverage technology to learn about other possibilities to save.

Build a Budget

Many children have no concept of money, especially how hard it can be to earn versus how easy it is to spend. I've noticed my kids put a lot more thought into what they spend when it's their own money compared to when mom and dad are footing the bill. Emphasizing a budget can make a world of difference, particularly in terms of how to prioritize.

When it comes to back-to-school shopping, teenagers are often picky about clothes and tend to prefer name-brand items. If you give them a finite amount to spend, they must then learn how to make decisions about where to splurge or save.

For example, how to take advantage of discount stores for basic day-to-day items, but maybe pay a higher amount for a special-occasion outfit in another store, so long as it fits within the overall budget.

Cash vs. Cards

These days, people use debit cards for just about everything. However, back-to-school shopping offers a great opportunity for parents to introduce pre-teens to cash purchases. Give them their own money to buy one or two items so they can have the tactile experience of safeguarding it and determining what they can get with a finite dollar amount, including any tax.

For high schoolers, back-to-school shopping is a good time to introduce a debit card so they can learn how to reconcile spending with a bank account. For college-age kids, I often recommend starting a low-balance credit card, which are offered on many campuses with a limit of only about $300 or $500. This represents an important distinction compared to debit cards, because the user must learn how to either write a check or make an electronic payment every month to cover previous purchases.

Life Lessons

Learning to budget doesn't come naturally for most people, especially those at a young age. Although back-to-school shopping is a great starting point, parents should reinforce the importance of budgeting throughout the school year, such as when children need supplies for projects or science fairs.

During the teenage years, a monthly allowance is also a good way to promote the importance of being conscious of spending. When kids reach college, it can be an opportunity for parents to cover living expenses but not entertainment options. As a result, young adults can learn how to save their own money for concerts, festivals or sporting events, by taking a part-time job or budgeting how much they eat out.

In the end, we all want what's best for our kids and that includes helping them understand how life choices can impact financial resources.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/24/2018/intuits-executive-exit-isnt-big-deal-companys-valuation,"Intuit's Executive Exit Isn't a Big Deal, but the Company's Valuation Is

Brad Smith's exit as CEO,along with the Chief Technology Officer, from Intuit (INTU) should not scare investors.

The shares rose 1.9% on Friday, a day after the company announced Smith will step down at the end of the year. Sasan Goodazri, who is now executive vice president for Intuit's Small Business and Self-Employed Group, will take on the CEO role. Smith won't leave Intuit altogether: he will serve on Intuit's board as Executive Chairman.

Executives come and go, and after eleven years it's not a huge shocker. The financial software company won't lose Smith completely as he's staying on the board. The news coincided with the company's fiscal fourth quarter results that outperformed expectations. If anything, investors should worry more about the stock being a little overpriced, rather than the departure of executives. Stifel Nicolaus announced an increase in their price target this morning to $250 a share. I think this is a stretch relative to actual earnings.

The owner of programs like TurboTax and Quickbooks, Intuit sits in a very nice spot vis-à-vis business cycles. Regardless of whether customers make money or lose money, everyone has to do taxes. There is somewhat of an assured demand for their services. Every small business has to keep their books, and Quickbooks is an invaluable tool in that regard. I think the nature of the services they provide mean the company will continue to do well because the industry is indispensible.

The problem that I do see is overvaluation. Intuit is too expensive. The financial growth has been great, but the stock is already showing much of the gains. Because of that, I think we're looking at a ""hold"" situation regardless of the CEO exit.

Intuit hasn't always produced consistent annual increases in net income under Smith's leadership. Revenue growth is consistent, but not as big as many other stocks out there. This isn't necessarily a criticism, as slow and steady can absolutely win the race, but it doesn't make me overly enthusiastic for the stock's valuation. The fourth quarter results brought Intuit's full year revenues to just under $6 billion. That's a 15% increase year over year. A larger portion of their revenue came from online activities, as the company is pushing into a Amazon Web Services capacity; having solid its large data center. This push led to a 43% increase in online Quickbooks subscribers. It should be noted that the quarter actually included an operating loss of $81 million; and tax provisions are what created profitable net income of $49 million.

It's not a huge deal though, as the year as a whole had net income of $1.21 billion. That's a 24.7% improvement year over year. The diluted earnings per share obtained from that income increased a comparable 24.8% to $4.72 a share.

These are great numbers, and shareholders should be happy. But when you look at them in regards to what the share price has done, I think a $250 price target is a reach. We're entering into a market that is beginning to favor results or promises, and value plays are more and more the name of the game. For the year, the company's non GAAP earnings of $5.61 beat the estimate range high of $5.57. But even at $5.61, Intuit trades at over 37x full year earnings. To me that's expensive for a stock that doesn't have a consistent five year trend of income growth.

Smith's replacement, Sasan Goodarzi, has been with the company for some time as an executive vice president of their small business division. I don't expect a huge shift from their current game plan of pushing more of their business online.

In a cloud-based world, it makes sense. But it doesn't make up for the valuation here.

In the coming months, I'm predicting limited upside in the stock price. This isn't because the company is performing poorly. The market has simply put way too much into this one already.

Even when Intuit beats estimates, it's usually pretty darn close. To that end, fiscal 2019 estimates of $6.47 will likely be in the ballpark. At those earnings, the stock would be trading at around 38x the full year's earnings. I'm no longer accepting those types of prices on stocks like this. At this stage of the bull market, I want value. If it were a startup, sure I'd maybe chance it. Investors can do what they want, but I'm out unless this thing comes back to maybe $180.",,
https://www.thestreet.com/markets/regulation/sears-is-spiraling-towards-delisting-14692926,"Shares of Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) were down 3.6% on Friday, Aug. 24, as the company remains, for now, safe from a delisting.

Year to date, Sears has fallen nearly 70%, bringing the company's stock price precipitously close to the $1 threshold that Nasdaq equities need to trade above to stay on the stock index.

Sears is trading in the $1.05 to $1.10 range and maintains a valuation well above the $1 million minimum that the Nasdaq requires.

The first step toward delisting is a ""deficiency notice"" sent by the Nasdaq if a company is in violation of the index's listing standards for a period of 30 consecutive days. Once the notice is sent, the company has 90 days to get back into compliance and stay in compliance for 10 consecutive days in the 90-day period.

If Sears fails to do this, the Nasdaq will then send the retailer a delisting letter that must be disclosed to the public within four business days. Once the letter is received, the company has seven days to request a hearing with the Nasdaq listing qualification panel, which postpones the delisting process until a decision is made.

A stock being delisted does not mean that it will no longer be traded. Delisted companies can turn to the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. So while a company getting delisted is never a good thing, and will inevitably hurt investor confidence, it's not a death sentence for a company.

Sears' road to profitability is getting steeper as the company announced Thursday, Aug. 23, that it will close an additional 46 Sears and Kmart stores in November. This came after the company announced 100 store closures in January and another 100 in May.

Sears has closed the majority of its 3,300 stores since its peak in 2006 and now operates less than 900 stores.

While the sector had its ups and downs during this earnings season, there were some clear winners.

On Wednesday, Aug. 22, Target Corporation (TGT) posted earnings that hit the bullseye, so to speak. The company posted a 6.4% increase in traffic growth and comparable sales growth of 6.5%. Target is only the latest retailer to beat expectations.

Companies like Walmart Inc (WMT) and Target, which are finding innovative ways to tackle Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , are making comebacks after analysts worried that Amazon might kill brick-and-mortar retail.

Unlike Target CEO Brian Cornell, who raved about the strength of the consumer in this economy, Giacomo Santangelo, a professor of economics at Fordham and Seton Hall universities, is cautious on consumer sentiment.

""Everything is good until the exact second it's not,"" he said. ""It's an illusion more than a fact.""

However, Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust feels bullish on the consumer. ""We think the consumer has been very strong this year,"" he said.

Stronger wage growth, strong job growth and the tax cuts in the tax packets are all reasons that Tilley cited. ""The jobs are very well disbursed,"" he said. This is ""the strongest wage growth we've had in the recovery"" from the recession.

The unemployment rate dropped to 3.9% in July and 157,000 jobs were added to the economy. Wage growth was up 2.7%.

""Yes, it's true that national unemployment is down, but that number may be measuring the wrong thing,"" said Santangelo.

Whether consumers are stronger or not, there's a lot to say about the current state of the economy. Most retailers discussed the economy in their investor calls this quarter. Here's what the biggest winners had to say.

Target Corp. (TGT)

On Target's investor call, Cornell focused briefly on the Chinese tariffs. Cornell expressed Target's concern about tariffs on Chinese imports and the possible effect on Americans, ""in addition, a prolonged deterioration in global trade relationships could damage economic growth and vitality in the United States.""

Cornell added, ""However, our concern is centered on the impact of tariffs on consumers and the economy, not our ability to manage our business in the face of these challenges.""

""In my career, I don't recall a stronger consumer environment than we have now,"" Cornell told TheStreet. He attributed the strength to GDP and the housing market.

TJ Maxx (TJX)

TJ Maxx released earnings on Tuesday, Aug. 23, posting an EPS of $1.17, better than FactSet expectations of $1.05.

CEO Ernie Herrman said the strong economy is making it easier for retailers. ""When the economy is getting better or retail is ticking up a notch, what you get there is the wholesalers getting more optimistic.""

On the Macy's call, the executive team sounded bullish on the consumer spending.

""Based on the first half performance, our strong execution and the anticipation of continued healthy consumer spending, we're raising both sales and earnings guidance for the year,"" said CEO Jeffrey Gennette.

He added, ""we are also benefiting from strong consumer confidence and spending, including growth in international tourist spending.""

Walmart (WMT)

Walmart's Dan Binder, VP of investor relations, spoke about consumers during Walmart's call. His comments referred to consumer strength during the massive chain's second quarter.

""Clearly, the consumer backdrop is favorable, we're getting a little bit of benefit from that,"" he said.

In response to an analyst's question, Binder said analysts ""on this call are really close to what the consumer is doing and the macro backdrop and we would reiterate that a lot of those key metrics that you look at, we look at. Job growth is great. Wages are up.""

""Consumer['s are] in great shape. In the surveys that we look at, they tell us that they are feeling good about their financial condition. We haven't seen any meaningful change in their spending patterns as gas prices have [increased]. I think there's a lot of offsets there, tax reform being one of the main ones. So, overall, we feel good about the consumer going into the back half of the year.""

Those four times are called earnings season, Cramer explained, and this quarter's financial reports resulted in its share of moronic snap judgments by the market. But the market's stupidity created plenty of buying opportunities.

Case in point: last week's action in Cramer favorite Home Depot (HD) . After posting another blowout quarter, shares initially rallied $3, only to reverse, falling $2 a share by the end of the company's conference call. Today, a week later, shares have risen $9.

A similar pattern played out yesterday with rival Lowe's (LOW) , the Action Alerts PLUS holding that had a terrific quarter, but saw shares sell off $3, before climbing $8.

Cramer's last examples were 3M (MMM) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) , which rallied $22 a share from its post-earnings low.

How can investors take advantage of these trends? Cramer said Children's Place (PLCE) reported a stunning 13% rise in same store sales today but, you guessed it, saw its shares decline anyway. Cramer said he'd be a buyer first thing tomorrow, before the rest of the market realizes its collective mistake.

Getting Retail Right

What's working in retail? Cramer said it isn't JCPenney (JCP) or L Brands (LB) , it's Williams-Sonoma (WSM) , which shot up 16.5% today after a monster quarter.

Williams-Sonoma had several strikes against it going into this quarter, Cramer explained. The company sells furniture, a dead category, and it competes with Amazon (AMZN) , where everyone loses. The company's freight costs are high, its stores are in the mall and. yes, many of its items are made in China and are now subject to tariffs. All of that should certainly doom the company, right?

Not so fast, Cramer said, as Williams-Sonoma saw accelerating earnings growth, strong same-store sales and boasted 53% of its business now comes from online.

Anyone who follows the fantastic management at Williams-Sonoma should have seen this coming, Cramer said. The company is a terrific operator with terrific leadership, and even this mountain of obstacles isn't going to stand in its way.

Chip Flip

It feels like we're living in an alternate reality, Cramer told viewers, one where chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has become a better investment than Intel (INTC) .

Cramer said the notion of AMD outperforming Intel would have been laughable five, 10 or even 20 years ago, but since CEO Lisa Su took the helm at AMD in 2014, that's exactly what's been happening. Turnarounds take a long time, Cramer explained, but Su was quick to restructure and refocus AMD, and the company is now taking market share in PCs and the data center.

Meanwhile, Intel has been plagued by delays in its next-generation chips and was ravaged by security issues in its current ones. Both of those things left an opening to AMD to flourish, just at the time when PCs were making a comeback and the data center and machine learning were accelerating.

Cramer said while shares of Intel are incredibly cheap, at just 11 times earnings, AMD is the one to own, even with shares trading at 35 times earnings. When considering the company's growth rate and looking ahead to 2020, Cramer said AMD is a lot less expensive than it looks.

Executive Decision: Tellurian

For his ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer again sat down with Charif Souki, co-founder and chairman of Tellurian Inc. (TELL) , one of our nation's newest liquified natural gas exporters. Cramer proclaimed that Souki was the father of the LNG export business in America with his first company, Cheniere Energy (LNG) , and now aims to repeat that performance with Tellurian.

When asked about the effects of tariffs on natural gas, Souki explained that it will have zero effect on the market. Natural gas is a commodity, he said. If the Chinese refuse American gas, that gas will just get substituted somewhere else. The rest of the world needs natural gas and America has it in spades. In fact, our country ""flares,"" or burns off 300 million cubic feet of gas every day as a byproduct of oil drilling.

Tellurian is so confident in its business, the company is now looking to buy up to 5 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves for its export terminal which is now being developed.

Cramer said he expects great things from Tellurian.

Off the Tape: ThirdLove

In his ""Off The Tape"" segment, Cramer sat down with Heidi Zak, co-founder and CEO of the privately-held ThirdLove, the company looking to disrupt the women's intimate apparel industry.

Zak explained that ThirdLove was the first company was founded to create a convenient online experience for women to shop for apparel. The company was the first to introduce bras in half sizes, because their research indicated that 30% of women needed them. While typical stores can only carry 36 sizes on their shelves, ThirdLove current has 70 different sizes and a waiting list of women waiting to get them.

Zak said that data drive all of the decisions they make and their data allow them to create specific segments of women and tailor marketing to speak directly to them. The company's online fit finder has been used by over 10 million women and with each one, the system only gets smarter at finding the right size.

Lightning Round

In the Lightning Round, Cramer was bullish on Centene (CNC) , Daseke (DSKE) , Briggs & Stratton (BGG) and Visa (V) .

Cramer was bearish on Oracle (ORCL) , Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) , Community Bank System (CBU) and Ally Financial (ALLY) .

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/alibabas-tmall.com-reigns-king-chinese-e-commerce,"Alibaba's Tmall.com Reigns as King of Chinese E-Commerce

Chinese e-commerce giant Tmall.com continues to dominate its market, generating rapid growth that serves as a good barometer for the fortunes of parent company Alibaba Holdings (BABA) .

When BABA reported Thursday that overall revenue grew 61% year over year to $12.3 billion during its fiscal first quarter, e-commerce headlined by Tmall served as a primary driver -- with Tmall and sister Chinese commerce site Taobao accounting for 86% of total revenue for the parent company. Tmall currently boasts a 51.3% share of the Chinese e-commerce market, according to an Analysys China research report.

""We gained incremental market share and a larger share of the consumer e-commerce wallet,"" BABA Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts during the company's earnings call. ""We continue to grow at scale because we had foresight to invest in technology, supply chain and logistics.""

Tsai added that he believes Tmall will continue to capture Chinese market share and help accelerate Alibaba's overall growth as the company integrates more of its so-called ""New Retail"" initiative into Tmall.com.

Tmall is already the largest business-to-consumer marketplace on the ""Top 500 Sites on the Web"" list tracked by Amazon's Alexa. In fact, it's the world's ninth-largest Web site overall -- ironically, two spots above Amazon (AMZN) itself.

Even more ironic is the acceptance by Tmall's competitors as their gateway to the Chinese consumer. For example, Amazon has maintained a store on Tmall.com since 2015, while major U.S. grocers and retailers like Kroger (KR) , Costco (COST) and Macy's (M) have all flocked to the platform to hock their products to the Chinese.

Alibaba also noted in Thursday's earnings release that Tmall is expanding its ""mindshare"" to other major non-Chinese retailers. For example, European retailers MCM Worldwide, Moschino SpA and Giuseppe Zanotti all added flagship ""stores"" on Tmall.com in just the past quarter. That makes Tmall essentially the world's most profitable doorman, as the largest companies in the world clamor to utilize its platform

Of course, that also means that Tmall faces significant challenges from upstart Chinese competitors like JD.com (JD) and Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY) . For example, JD.com controls more than 32.9% of the Chinese e-commerce market and has partnered with Walmart (WMT) in the Chinese market on delivery and e-commerce transactions.

Oppenheimer & Co.'s Jason Helfstein wrote in a report ahead of Alibaba's earnings release that ""fierce competition among various rivals"" represented a significant risk factor that ""may hurt growth trajectory.""

But while Tmall faces some potential risks from competitors, results so far indicate that the unit's upward trajectory hasn't been slowed by challengers yet. Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Real Money he was impressed by such significant revenue growth for an already multi-billion-dollar company. ""E-commerce [was] really the story of the quarter,"" he said.",,Walmart
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/alibaba-takes-page-amazons-playbook-cloud-computing,"Alibaba Takes a Page From Amazon's Playbook on Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is becoming an increasingly important part of Alibaba Holdings Limited's (BABA) business as the company takes a page from Amazon's playbook of successful growth.

Cloud computing revenue for Alibaba grew an extraordinary 93% year-over-year, reaching $710 million in the past quarter.

The business segment has been strengthened this summer, as the company in June announced major cloud computing partnerships with Minsheng Bank, China Communications Construction Group, and InterContinental Hotels Group for major cloud migration contracts.

""Our cloud computing business continued its rapid growth over the past quarter,"" CEO Daniel Zhang told analysts Thursday morning during the earnings presentation. ""Alibaba Cloud launched more than 660 new products and features during the quarter, including a language-based document and analysis tools, hybrid disaster recovery for enterprises, and a big data analytical tools.""

He added that Chinese broadcasters chose to partner with Alibaba in order to stream the wildly popular FIFA world cup in the nation.

""I see China a lot like Amazon (AMZN) was four or five years ago, as some big names are increasing demand for cloud solutions,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Real Money in an interview. ""It could be an important part of their story in the future.""

However, Hottovy was also quick to point out that the cloud computing segment is cost intensive, presenting a short-term drag on profits, leading to a $74 million net EBITA loss in the quarter on the segment overall.

""It's going to take some investment,"" he said. ""But obviously it took some serious investment for Amazon to get where it is now.""

While stopping short of considering cloud computing as a future contributor to revenue on the scale of the business' current e-commerce segment, he speculated it could reach up to about 10% of revenues for the business, about twice its current percentage.

He gives the stock a price target of $240, noting that it is undervalued by today's market. Alibaba shares closed Thursday at $172.23, a decline of 3.2% for the day.

Speculating on reasons why it remains undervalued, he suggested the U.S.-China trade war and general economic concerns about China.

""It could be just general concern on China and trade wars,"" he said. ""But I think the company made a pretty good case this morning on why they're protected from that.""",,Amazon

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/starbucks-plans-big-digital-future-china-alibabas-help,"Starbucks Plans a Big Digital Future in China, with Alibaba's Help

As high-level trade relations between U.S. and China remain uncertain, American coffee leader Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) is moving aggressively to expand its digital and delivery capabilities in China alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) .

Announced earlier this month, the Chinese Internet giant and the U.S. coffee retailer will ""transform Starbucks China into a digital operation,"" Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in the company's earnings this morning.

The partnership underscores how many U.S. companies view China as a significant market for future growth, despite high-level politics and trade war headlines in recent months.

In China, Starbucks controls 58.6% of the overall coffee market in China, accounting for $1.3 billion, in revenues for the coffee purveyor in the second quarter.

""As demonstrated by our partnership with Starbucks, we are working constructively with American brands to better serve Chinese consumers,"" said Joseph Tsai, co-founder and executive vice chairman of Alibaba, on a call on Thursday.

The cross-platform collaboration will include ""digital stores in Alibaba consumer Apps, coffee delivery for online orders, and the loyalty program collaboration,"" the company said.

Starbucks' growth story in the country so traditionally tea-crazy that Chairman Mao elected to use it as toothpaste has been a remarkable one for Starbucks. In only 20 years, the Seattle-based chain has now opened 3,400 stores, with plans for up to 6,000, making it ideal for the scale that Alibaba is seeking to prove its platform at.

""The strategic partnership with Starbucks is proof of our New Retail model at scale and showcases how Alibaba can help our brand partners more deeply and innovatively engage with their customers in China,"" an Alibaba press release this morning explained.

Jefferies Financial Group Inc (JEF) equity analyst Andy Barish also saw the opportunity as a boon for the coffee company.

""Delivery is now a 'lifestyle' for Chinese consumers, so the absence of a [third party delivery] offering had a detrimental impact on sales,"" he wrote in a research note on August 2. ""BABA sets SBUX up to capture this opportunity, and extend its quality-assured, premium retail experience beyond its four walls.""

Good Synergies with Alibaba

As reported by Real Money's contributor Chris Versace, the transition to the ""new retail"" model is a hallmark of a ""digital lifestyle"" promoted by Alibaba.

He suggested that Alibaba has room to grow even to $250 per share based on this lifestyle.

On the other hand, while the program seems to be a ""dream team"" partnership on paper, the complexities of a Chinese-American partnership in today's climate is certainly precarious given ongoing trade tensions.

A collaboration with an upmarket foreign brand like Starbucks poses challenges should the Chinese economy continue to deteriorate and ""look terrible"", as US economic advisor Larry Kudlow puts it, and Chinese consumers no longer wish to purchase expensive frappuccinos.

It could also pose risk if the Chinese government decides to introduce measure to punish U.S. companies operating in China.

The partnership, which should help Starbucks hold off Chinese rivals, offers Alibaba a testing ground for its ele.me delivery project and will certainly be one to watch as both expand aggressively into digital delivery space.",,Starbucks
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/alibaba-shakes-trade-war-concerns-stays-focused-domestic-consumer,"Alibaba Shakes Off Trade War Concerns, Stays Focused on Domestic Consumer

Analysts are remaining confident in Alibaba's (BABA) ability to perform, downplaying the trade standoff's impact on the company.

The company's net income gained 45% to $1.2 billion, while revenues rose 61% to $12.2 billion during the same quarter compared to a year ago.

In an earnings presentation this morning, the e-commerce and cloud giant noted that its user base and revenue continues to grow despite macroeconomic pressures from tariffs and trade.

Alibaba executive chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts that both China and Alibaba are well prepared to absorb the impact of trade tensions, as they stay focused on domestic economy.

""Alibaba's business is focused on capturing the Chinese domestic consumption opportunity and less reliant on Chinese exports,"" he explained. ""We believe that Chinese government policy will continue to support imports into China to satisfy the rising demand of Chinese consumers.""

He added that is the U.S. goods are priced out of the Chinese marketplace by tariffs, consumers will simply shift to domestic producers.

Growing Middle Class

Suntrust Robinson analyst Youssef Squalli likewise expressed his lack of concern on the macro factors in a note published after the earnings presentation this morning.

""While the stock was recently pressured by concerns around a trade war with the US, and a softening Chinese economy, we believe both are manageable for the company,"" he wrote. ""On the trade war issue, BABA remains first and foremost a play on the rise of domestic Chinese consumption, with relatively small reliance on US consumers.""

Currently, the company has an annual active user base of 576 million customers, adding 24 million from the previous year.

CFO Maggie Wei Wu specifically noted the company's ability to continue expanding user base in lower tier customers during the earnings this morning, lauding the company's price point initiatives as effective regardless of shifting economic conditions in China broadly.

""About 80% of these net adds are from lower tier cities as we broaden our offerings and services into those regions,"" she explained.

Squalli indicated that he believes this is a good indicator for the continued rise of the Chinese middle class despite macroeconomic pressures.

""In terms of the slowing Chinese economy, 80% of the new active consumers came from lower tier cities, reflecting strong demand from rising income and rising middle class, which we believe can be sustainable for some time,"" he wrote.

As a result, he maintained his buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $215.

To be sure, Chinese markets overall have indeed been stung by political bluster over trade and the imposition of billions in tariffs.

Year to date, the Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 17.61%, reflecting trouble in some of the largest Chinese companies, including Alibaba, which itself has fallen in market cap by almost $100 million since June.

However, as the bulk of its business is protected from trade-related external headwinds, both the company and analysts seem confident the e-commerce titan can wait out the storm.

""It is clear that nobody wins in a trade war,"" Tsai told analysts on the earnings call. ""Over the years, China has become less reliant on exports so that the Chinese economy can withstand the imposition of tariffs on Chinese products.""",,
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/kohls-just-reported-a-great-quarter-but-analysts-are-worried-about-long-term-growth-14691864,"All in on Kohl's?

Kohl's Corp. (KSS) reported a quarter in which it topped analysts' earnings expectations by 12 cents a share. But analysts at Morgan Stanley are concerned about the retailer's long-term growth.

While Morgan Stanley raised the company's price target to $51 from its previous view of $45, it also maintained its ""underweight"" rating on the stock.

The reason for the pessimism?

Morgan Stanley analysts said they believe that it will be hard for the company to achieve its second-half same-store sales guidance.

""In our view, traffic growth is necessary to sustainably drive comp sales growth. We agree with Kohl's focus on driving traffic and admire its various initiatives such as its partnership with Aldi to increase footfall. However, we have not yet seen evidence that its strategies will be enough to sustainably drive positive traffic,"" analyst Kimberly Greenberger said.

The firm, however, acknowledged that the company's fundamentals do leave room for optimism.

""Over the past 5 trailing years, KSS has grown operating income y/y in 9 quarters (vs. 20 total quarters); however, it has only grown operating income once over that same period when it has had to lap a quarter with prior positive income growth,"" Greenberger wrote. ""Lapping these periods of operating income growth would likely provide the evidence that we seek to suggest a sustainable turn around in operating profit growth is taking place and also imply that KSS has figured out how to grow, despite the various secular headwinds it faces.""

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/alibaba-benefits-continued-adoption-digital-lifestyle,"Alibaba Benefits from Continued Adoption of 'Digital Lifestyle'

Alibaba (BABA) shares are climbing higher today on the back of its quarterly earnings report that delivered year over year revenue growth of more than 60% with double-digit gains across its core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and innovation businesses.

That robust performance, which led quarterly revenue to hit $12.23 billion for the quarter, besting consensus expectations of $12.02 billion. Paired with double-digit earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth is more than overshadowing a $0.02 per share miss on the company's bottom line, which came in at $1.22 per share.

Alibaba has long been heralded as the Amazon (AMZN) of China given its position in digital shopping (84% of revenue) but that's about where the similarities end.

At Alibaba, all the company's operating profit is derived from its core commerce business with the remaining 16% of its revenue stream spread across cloud, digital media and innovation initiatives all offsetting weighing on that profit stream. By comparison, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's profit and cash flow secret weapon as I like to call it.

Shrinking Losses

That's the negative, but if we look at the year over year comparisons of the non-core commerce businesses, not only are they growing quickly but year over year Alibaba is shrinking their losses across the board.

In many respects this is similar to one of the key concerns investors once had with Amazon - can it turn a consistent profit? We have seen that for a number of quarters in a row, and investors have removed that objection, which has sent AMZN shares significantly higher over the last several quarters.

With Alibaba, the question is not whether those businesses become profitable, but rather when. Yes, much like Amazon, Alibaba continues to invest for future growth as evidenced by the level of capital spending in the June quarter vs. the year ago and declining cash on the balance sheet.

Both of these reflect investments to -- much like Amazon -- move past its core commerce platforms, into physical retail and food-delivery services, as well as expanding its footprint in areas such as logistics and in overseas markets.

That said, the company is benefiting from the continued adoption of what I call the Digital Lifestyle. This is evidenced by the continued growth in both active consumers on its retail marketplace as well as mobile monthly active users. Exiting June, the company's annual active consumers reached 576 million, up nearly 24% year over year, while its mobile monthly active users hit 634 million, up 20% year over year.

Much like Amazon's Prime business, as Alibaba expands its scope of product and services, at least in the near-term, it should continue to win new users and retain existing ones. Also much like Amazon, Alibaba will continue to grab incremental consumer wallet share. The combination should continue to drive top line growth and pull its non-core commerce businesses into the black.

Heading into today's earnings report, consensus EPS for Alibaba this year was $5.97 per share, up from the $4.77 achieved in 2017. Given the overall performance of the June quarter, odds are we could see that expectation move higher but the real focus for investors will be the $7.88 consensus EPS for 2019. What the math shows is an expectation for 28% EPS growth over the 2017-2019 time frame, and against that backdrop BABA shares are trading at a PEG ratio of 0.82 based on 2019 EPS expectations.

In coming months, odds are we will see continued growth in China digital commerce as China consumers build up for the year-end holidays and Chinese New Year. That along with other gains in its cloud and digital media businesses should see Alibaba closing the profit gap leading to not only more comparisons to Amazon, but to multiple expansion that offers upside to $240-$250, if not more.

The one obvious risk is the impact of trade and tariffs between the U.S. and China, which stepped up today. My thinking is given the slowing economic data of late from China and potential mid-term election risk, President Trump could be angling for an October-early November trade win. Not only would that send the overall U.S. stock market higher, but it would remove the trade concerns from BABA shares as well.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) is widely regarded to be the Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) of China. Like Amazon, Alibaba's most important metric in its earnings report is growth. The market doesn't care too much about the bottom line as long as BABA continues its spectacular growth.

This morning Alibaba posted earnings per share of $1.22, which is roughly in line with estimates, but the story here is that revenue was up 65% and ahead of consensus estimates. Growth of 65% on a base of $7.4 billion in sales is remarkable. This pace of growth is down a little from last quarter, when revenue was up 76%, but this is the sort of growth the market is seeking and it is why the stock is up around 4% in premarket trading.

Valuation arguments on Alibaba are difficult. The company has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35 and expects growth of 32% in 2020, which is very reasonable. However, the 3% earnings-per-share growth seen in the current quarter is what has caused Alibaba to lag recently. In the long run Alibaba's revenue growth eventually is going to feed that bottom line and, like Amazon, the potential there is very robust.

Is Alibaba a buy here? Technically, the chart is ambiguous at best. The stock has been in a wide trading range over the past year and has struggled due in part to weakness in the Chinese equity markets.

The report this morning is spiking Alibaba up to resistance at the 200-day simple moving average around $186.60. It is likely that the stock will need some time to work through that resistance.

I would not be in a rush to chase Alibaba at the open, but would consider it as a longer-term investment as it consolidates in this area. There is nothing compelling about the chart right now. The stock is right in the middle of the trading range and is likely to drift around between $170 and $210 for a while. The poor China market is one of the issues that is going to keep it contained in the near term.

Alibaba has the potential to perform like Amazon over the longer term, but right now I'd rate it a hold with the potential for positive development.",,Amazon
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/alibaba-investor-china-has-make-deal,"Alibaba Investor: China Has to Make a Deal

Despite solid earnings, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) stock declined 3.2% on Thursday after futile trade talks in Washington and mounting investor concerns.

Ross Gerber, a president and chief executive officer of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, is concerned.

His firm, which owns about $900,000 in Alibaba stock as part of a $25 million investment in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, has been trimming back its Alibaba stake in the past month over fears China will lose out in the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.

Gerber was also concerned about the spread between the company's revenue beat and drop in profit.

""It is our viewpoint that China has to make a deal,"" Gerber said. ""For the last month we've been trimming because China is acting ignorant and won't accept the bully(the U.S.) it doesn't like.""

Gerber added that Alibaba's structure coupled with often difficult to reconcile earnings results spooks investors. The reported 61% jump in revenue by the company but a 41% profit drop due to costs around recent fundraising should raise eyebrows, he continued.

""The main thing with companies in China investors need to be cognizant of is that these companies don't play by the same rules you play with in America,"" Gerber said. ""If you get a question on an earnings report it can be a little scary because you can't kick the tires of these companies.""

The Hangzhou-based and New York-listed company beat analyst estimates earlier on revenue and earnings per share, posting a 61% increase in revenue year over year.

U.S. introduced 25% tariffs on more Chinese goods, worth about $16 billion, which came into effect at midnight.

The Chinese delegation is in Washington, D.C. this week to discuss trade war. China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen is scheduled to meet with US Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass.

The meetings failed to produce an agreement or reassure markets so far.

Earlier in the day, Alibaba reported solid earnings. The company posted a revenue of 80.92 billion yuan, or about $12.23 billion, was credited to significant increases year over year in core-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and innovation initiatives.

""The exceptional growth across our major segments of core commerce, cloud computing and digital media and entertainment validates our strategy of investing in customer experience, product, technology and infrastructure for the future,"" CFO Maggie Wu said in a statement announcing the earnings release.

Jack Ma-led internet giant posted increases of 61%, 93%, and 46% on core commerce, cloud computing, and digital media respectively, showing a capacity to grow amid macroeconomic pressures.

Core commerce accounted for the lion's share of revenue, rising to $10.46 billion, or about 86% of revenues.

The growth in revenue was helped in part by a rapidly growing consumer base in Alibaba's home market and the world's most populous nation.

The company reported that active users increased by 24 million, about the population of Texas per the 2010 census, in the past year. The active user base has now reached 576 million people, almost 250 million more people than the population of the entire United States.

""Our China retail marketplace business continues to gain share,"" CEO Daniel Zhang said this morning, indicating that there is room to grow despite its already hulking consumer base.

Cloud computing, while making up a smaller percentage of the revenue, saw the steepest growth curve.

The acceleration in revenue growth was carried by large-scale partnerships like Minsheng Bank, China Communications Construction Group, and Intercontinental Hotels Group, all of which have chosen to utilize Alibaba's ""Lightning Cube"" cloud migration services. This service allows the company to migrate petabytes of information for these major partners.

The growth is helping Alibaba chip into Amazon's lead in the cloud infrastructure market. As of a February Synergy Research Group report, Alibaba was the fifth largest cloud infrastructure provider in the world behind Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.

To be sure, despite its positive earnings report, as external macroeconomic pressures including the US-China trade war are sure to impact future earnings possibilities and a slowdown in overall Chinese markets impacts the ability of consumers to make purchases.

""A slowdown in consumption and ecommerce might dampen revenue growth outlook in the coming quarters,"" JP Morgan analyst Alex Yao wrote in a note from August 17, anticipating the earnings.

The dampening so far this summer has depressed the share price from a height of $211.70 in June, wiping tens of billions from the company's market cap.

So, while the earnings for the past quarter is strong, it is worth observing the climb back to its early summit that the company must pursue.

Overall, as Alibaba continues to expand its user base by tens of millions and drive revenue increases year over year totaling more than 50%, even serious macroeconomic factors are having a difficult time holding the stock down.",,Amazon
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/23/2018/jim-cramer-why-traders-are-shopping-williams-sonoma-after-stellar-earnings,"Jim Cramer: Why Traders Are Shopping for Williams-Sonoma After Stellar Earnings

In the business of stocks, you are always searching for an analogue, something that can be used to clarify and strengthen your critical thinking so you can be divorced from emotion and become more thoughtful about stock picking.

In retail, Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is that retailer.

Last night, Williams-Sonoma reported what is pretty much the perfect quarter in a moment filled with excellent reports -- so many that it is easier to say which ones didn't explode to the upside -- JC Penney (JCP) and L Brands (LB) , both of which seem caught in a time warp that feels very death-rattle-like, especially in the case of L Brands, which cut numbers again and is seeing its core franchises, Victoria's Secret and, now, Pink, fade into darkness.

But now, back to our analogue.

We know that retail has had a series of unrelenting challenges over the past few years -- a strapped consumer, raw costs, Amazon (AMZN) , and now the President with his tariff-obsession with China. Intellectually, it seems too much for retail, which was supposed to wilt under these pressures. AMZN is an Action Alerts Plus holding.

When I look at the short positions -- the bets against retail -- they are crowded, meaning they have way too many people betting against them, for all of the reasons just mentioned.

Few have more shorts in their name than Williams-Sonoma. Why not? Strike one: it sells furniture, a dead category for ages. Two, it can't compete with Amazon on the scale that the Seattle giant offers. Three, it has tremendous freight costs, which we know has been a principal cause of shortfalls. Four, it has heavy mall presence in an era where, while not dying, the mall isn't exactly thriving either, unless you are of the strip variety, which is definitely not Williams-Sonoma. And five, a huge percentage of the world's furniture is made in China and the president is about to put on a 25% tariff on imports of that furniture.

That, theoretically, is way too much for Williams-Sonoma and its management team led by Laura Alber.

Right?

Wrong.

The company delivered stellar numbers on the top and bottom line, with accelerating growth and fantastic comps across all its many brands -- from Pottery Barn to West Elm to flagship Williams-Sonoma, at least on a two-year stacked basis.

Fifty-three percent of the company's business is online -- and it is by far its most lucrative channel, by some more than three times more lucrative because it is so well-honed and isn't hampered by brick and mortar costs. The web just makes it so much cheaper to do business.

As Alber said, and it isn't blowing smoke: ""our powerful, multi-channel, multi-brand platform, together with our strong execution of our strategic initiatives in digital leadership, product innovation and operational excellence are having a positive impact on all parts of our business.""

We have heard endlessly about the rising costs of freight and how it would force stores to raise prices and lose shares or sales. It was brought up on the call by the analysts who seem mystified by how management could avoid this painful topic. Management then didn't downplay it, but simply adjusted and said supply chain efficiencies ""completely offset it."" So basically, something that has felled many a company this quarter didn't hurt WSM.

The tariffs? Fifteen percent of the cost of goods sold would be subject to the $200 billion in tariffs currently proposed. Sounds bad? Wait: ""we are aggressively working to mitigate the potential impact of these tariffs on our financial results while maintaining our customer value proposition."" That includes moving production out of China -- because the company has a multi-country supply chain. The loser won't be the American consumer. It will be China.

Finally, the big drawback with furniture is visualization. My wife had a tiff with a West Elm manager when she wasn't allowed to take a chair 440 yards to our home in Summit, New Jersey to see what it would look like. She decided not to buy the table and chairs, a thousand-dollar-plus ticket lost. Now she would just visualize it using WSM's artificial intelligence techniques.

Brick and mortar? They are using the good stores as showrooms, the bad ones are being closed aggressively. Why have an unprofitable store in this day in age? Finally, they have added a robust loyalty campaign across all their myriad brands, which is producing 3x the sales from customers who adopt it.

In short, every objection answered in this analogue. Shorts won't like it; longs? I bet they take some of their considerable profits and shop there.",,
https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/dont-forget-the-consumer-cramers-mad-money-recap-aug-22-14691202,"Are investors looking at our economy all wrong? Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Wednesday that with all of the focus on manufacturing and trade, we're losing sight of what's most important -- consumer spending.

This is a classic situation of not being able to see the forest through the trees, Cramer explained. The president may grab all of the headlines talking about tariffs and trade, but our economy is still dominated by consumers, and consumer spending was front and center in this quarter's earnings.

Nearly every retailer posted monster gains this quarter, including Target (TGT) , Kohl's (KSS) , TJX Companies (TJX) , Home Depot (HD) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) . Target saw a monster 6.5% boost in same-store sales in what management called the best consumer environment they've ever seen.

How did Wall Street analysts not see this move coming? Cramer said first, it's because they incorrectly assumed that a slowdown in housing equated to a slowdown in spending. It doesn't.

Next, they also assumed that Amazon (AMZN) was going to take over the world. Yet off-price retailers, home goods retailers, auto parts and drugstores have all largely been unaffected thus far.

Finally, Wall Street got it wrong because, yes, millennials. Younger consumers continue to spend money on accessories, video games, experiences and more.

Don't Be Distracted by Politics

Political turmoil is again dominating our headlines, Cramer told viewers, but that doesn't mean they will have any meaningful impact on the quarterly earnings of your favorite companies.

Cramer said that for as worrisome as yesterday's headlines were for President Trump, given the political landscape, he will likely remain untouchable for the rest of his term. That said, a weakened president typically means a weakened U.S. dollar, and that could actually be a good thing for our multi-national companies.

""What does all of this mean for the earnings of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,"" as well as the earnings for most other companies you follow?, Cramer asked. Well, not much, as most political events like these have historically been brushed aside by investors.

'Bad Blood,' the Tale of Theranos

In a special interview, Cramer sat down with John Carreyrou, investigative reporter at The Wall Street Journal and the author of the new book, ""Bad Blood,"" which details the story of Theranos, and its charismatic CEO, Elizabeth Holmes.

Carreyrou first reported on the Theranos case in October 2015 and has followed the investigation, which has led to 11 counts of fraud, and evidence of efforts to both defraud investors and also doctors and patients about tests that simply didn't exist. Carreyrou said he doesn't think Holmes started off with a plan to commit fraud, but after her technology ran into setback after setback, she chose to lie rather than admit the truth.

In the end, Theranos went live with tests that did not use the company's own technology, but rather diluted samples so they could be used with existing technology. The result was the voiding of one million tests, an event which endangered the public health.

Carreyrou continued by saying he feels Holmes suffers from ""noble cause syndrome"" where the ends justify the means, even if that means defrauding the public and your investors over the short term.

Purr-fect Investing Ideas

The bull market in pet-related products rages on, Cramer told viewers, so much so that he felt compelled to create the ""Mad Money Humanization of Pets Index,"" a fictional ETF to track this powerful theme.

Among those included in the index were IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) , Zoetis (ZTS) and FreshPet (FRPT) . Cramer said each of these key players would be weighted 15% each in the index.

Then there was Central Garden & Pet (CENT) , Pet IQ (PETQ) , a guest segment on Tuesday night's episode, and PetMed Express (PETS) . Cramer said he's weighting each of these companies at 10% of the index.

Finally, there were the tangential pet companies, including General Mills (GIS) , which owns Blue Buffalo. Cramer gave General Mills 8% of the index. Lastly, Henry Schein (HSIC) , JM Smucker (SJM) and Walmart (WMT) , our nation's largest pet supply retailer.

How would you have done investing in the Mad Money Pet Index? Based on the current mix, you'd be up 30% so far in 2018 and 144% over the past three years.

Executive Decision: Exact Sciences

For his ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Kevin Conroy, CEO of Exact Sciences (EXAS) , a stock which soared 30.5% Wednesday after the company announced a partnership with Pfizer (PFE) to help market ColoGuard, the company's at-home test for colon cancer.

Conroy explained that every year 50,000 people die from colon cancer, a preventable and curable disease if caught early. Yet, two out of every five Americans have still not been screened for colon cancer. Big problems call for big solutions, Conroy said, and Pfizer brings the resources and the credibility for Exact Sciences to reach their goal of 10 million screenings a year.

Currently, ColoGuard only has 3% marketshare, Conroy said, and that's why Pfizer is the perfect partner to help spread the word to doctors and patients.

When asked about other products in their pipeline, Conroy said they're very excited about a new test which can detect 95% of liver cancers with a simple blood draw. He said the test could be a game changer, as liver cancer has thus far been difficult to detect.

Lightning Round

In the Lightning Round, Cramer was bullish on XPO Logistics (XPO) , Amgen (AMGN) , Dropbox (DBX) , Spotify (SPOT) and Intuit (INTU) .

Cramer was bearish on Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) , Ford Motor (F) and Avalara (AVLR) .

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/22/2018/target-rings-41-e-commerce-growth-latest-quarter,"Target Rings Up 41% E-Commerce Growth in Latest Quarter

Target Corp. (TGT) continues to increase its footprint in e-commerce, growing by 41% in the second quarter despite an ever-more-crowded digital-retail space populated by bigger players like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) . The program's acceleration, disclosed Wednesday as part of Target's second-quarter earnings release, has been a welcome change for the retailer, which had been lambasted by analysts in the past for its lack of digital presence.

""TGT is one of the most-exposed retailers in our universe to the digital threat,"" Wells Fargo Senior Analyst Edward Kelly wrote in a note. ""Investors have been critical of management for being slow to react to the structural change, but the company now appears to be taking aggressive action.""

Kelly lauded such elements of Target's digital strategy as a ""ship-to-store"" program, where in-store customers complete purchases that are delivered to their homes. He also praised TGT's Drive-Up service, where orders placed via Target's mobile app arrive for pick up outside of your local store. Kelly said such moves help differentiate Target from both traditional competitors and the aforementioned bigger players.

""The strategy is clearly focused on building a digital platform that leverages [Target's] existing store base as opposed to buying/building pure-play digital assets,"" he wrote. ""We don't disagree with the company's thinking, as the cost of competing with Amazon and even Wal-Mart at this point with similar strategies would be extremely high.""

Target CFO Catherine Smith described the initiative during the chain's earnings call Wednesday as a blurring of the lines between digital and in-store sales. ""Our stores are fulfilling much of that 41% digital growth,"" she said. ""And so, we're going to start talking less and less at some point about our actual 'digital' sales, because it is truly our entire business, fueled by those stores.""

Even bearish Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman, who gives the stock an ""Underweight"" rating, said in a note that he had to ""give credit where it is due"" on e-commerce, calling TGT's gains in that area ""stellar relative to a majority of retailers."" However, Gutman added that some of Target's e-commerce gains were ""likely aided by a calendar shift (extra week of back-to-school sales) and the introduction of free two-day shipping.""

To be sure, a play that relies so heavily on the existing bricks-and-mortar stores and merchandise pick-ups isn't an entirely diversifying move for the company. Further, it's not entirely certain that Amazon and Walmart can't still displace Target, as their market share already exceeds Target's and doesn't rely as heavily on existing retail real estate.

And while e-commerce is accelerating at Target, it still only accounted for less than $1 billion of the company's $18 billion second-quarter sales. TGT's e-commerce volume also seems even less impressive when compared to Amazon's $52.9 billion in second-quarter sales.

Yet while Target remains well behind competitors in e-commerce and lacks meaningful market share at this point, the firm's rapid second-quarter growth in the category indicates one thing -- there's still room for TGT's e-commerce sales to grow.",,Walmart
https://www.thestreet.com/markets/target-blows-earnings-out-of-water-14689982,"Target Corp. (TGT) proved retail isn't being squashed by Amazon.

At the time of the closing bell, Target was up over 3% to $85.75 a share.

The retailer posted earnings on Wednesday, August 22. The 6.4% increase in traffic growth is the strongest number it has posted since the company started reporting traffic in 2008. It also announced comparable sales growth of 6.5%, which is the largest increase in 13 years.

Comparable digital sales increased 41%, which tops the growth of 32% reported a year ago.

""Target hit the bulls-eye in Q2, with improvement across virtually every meaningful measure, led by online sales growth of 41% and comparable store sales growth of almost 5%,"" said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead retail analyst. ""The raising of guidance for the back half of the year is consistent with our view that there are macroeconomic tailwinds that can be exploited by the strongest, most financially flexible retailers that are hitting on all cylinders, with Target definitely in that class.""

Target posted an adjusted earnings per share of $1.47, which beat FactSet analysts expectations of $1.40.

""We are extremely pleased with Target's second quarter results, which demonstrate our guests' excitement for the enhanced and differentiated shopping experience we're building. For the second consecutive quarter, traffic growth is better than we've seen in well over 10 years, driving 6.5 percent comp growth - Target's best in 13 years."" said Cornell, CEO of Target. ""We laid out a clear strategy at the beginning of 2017, and throughout this year we've been accelerating the pace of execution. We're on track to deliver a strong back half and we've updated our full year guidance to reflect the strength of our business and the consumer economy. As we look ahead to 2019, we expect to achieve scale across the full slate of our initiatives - creating efficiencies and cost-savings, further strengthening our guest experience and positioning Target to continue gaining market share.""

Revenue also increased to $17.55 billion, beating FactSet expectations of $17.23 billion.

Following the earnings, Baird analysts boosted Target's price target to $100 from $90 after the ""impressive"" second quarter earnings. Target is currently rated as outperform at Baird.

""We anticipate [Target] shares outperform given strong comp growth and likely modest favorable revisions to F2018 consensus EPS. Our $85 price target is under review with an upward bias,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan wrote in a note on Target's earnings.

Stifel sent out another note after the market closed, updating that it had bumped up Target's 12-month price target to $93.

When speaking about tariffs on the investor conference call, Cornell said, ""our concern is focused on the impact of tariffs on the consumer and the economy, not on our business model.""

On the call, Target said that it remodeled over 250 of its stores in July, which is the highest amount of remodels that Target has undertaken at one time.

Target announced that the drive-up service, which allows consumers to have a Target employee bring out items to the customers car, went from being available at 50 locations at the beginning of the year to over 800 locations at the end of the second quarter.

""The momentum that we're seeing across our business is amazing,"" said Mark Tritton, chief merchandising officer, on the investor call.

Target said that its aiming brands towards ""emerging Gen Z guests.""

Target's tax rate was 10% lower than last year, due to the tax cuts, reported Cathy Smith, CFO.

Smith talked about the ""bold investment"" plan that Target rolled out in 2017. She said that the plan has paid off.

""I feel really good about the efforts of the team,"" said Cornell. He talked about the ""mixed management"" of online and in-store, saying that the combined efforts boosted the quarter.

""We know we have a lot of work to do,"" said Cornell. He told analysts that a focus will be on improving inventory.

""90% of retail sales are done in-store,"" Cornell said. Discussing winners and losers in retail, ""we certainly think we're migrating to the winners column.""

""85% of America shops Target every year,"" said Cornell. The closure of Toys R Us and Baby's R Us did drive toy sales, he added.

""We put the stores in the center of our overall strategy,"" Cornell responded to TheStreet's @BrianSozzi. ""Our stores are fulfilling [the majority] of our online orders.""

""In my career, I don't recall a stronger consumer environment than we have now,"" Cornell said. He attributed the strength to GDP and the housing environment.

The ""economy is showing no sign of weakness,"" said David Russell, VP of content strategy at Tradestation. ""We're in an environment where there have been a lot of boogeymen [student loans, debt, etc.].""

Target, in its investor relations phone call, mentioned that it was not only chasing after Millennials, but also Gen Z. ""I think that's very smart...to reach out to Gen Z,"" said Jennifer Olson, senior financial analyst at Apriem Advisors. ""[Target] is in a better position to attract a younger generation."" Olson credited the fall of Toys R Us as a boost for Target.

When asked what he thought about the Target numbers, Jeff Macke, president of Macke Asset Management and a Target bull, responded that the numbers were ""glorious.""

There has been plenty of news today, but here are the top stories on TheStreet.

AMD vs. Intel

You ready for this fight?

TheStreet's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi scoffs at the idea of a fight. According to him, AMD is pummeling Intel.

The mood on Wall Street is that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) continues to take market share from wounded Intel (INTC) .

Ouch.

""As Nvidia (NVDA - Get Report) increases its lead in the graphics market, all eyes are on AMD's EPYC server sales as investors track the company's efforts to reach their market share goals; mid-single digit share by EOY 2018 and double-digit by EOY 2019. And based on our checks, we see no reason to change our long-held belief that AMD is well-positioned to disrupt the server market. We note that EPYC demand from major server manufacturers looks very strong through the end of 2018 as AMD takes advantage of INTC's 10nm issues and security flaws,"" said Jeff Johnston, an analyst at Arthur Wood.

Sticking With the Chips: Nvidia's a Fighter

Nvidia (NVDA) hosted an early presentation at the Autonomous Vehicle 2018 conference in Novi, Mich.

TheStreet's autonomous driving expert @BretKenwell talks all thing Nvidia.

The innovative tech company has been in the news lately, too. Whether that's the more recently announced Turing GPU architecture, the keynote presentation from CEO Jensen Huang in Cologne, Germany or the quarterly earnings results Nvidia released on Aug. 16.

While the quarter had some bumps around cryptocurrency, the rest of the results were very, very strong. Datacenter, gaming and automotive all displayed impressive traction and aren't showing many signs of slowing down.

Another Nvidia product that should safely accelerate the realization of autonomous driving? DRIVE Constellation, a colossal project that will allow developers to test their programs in virtual worlds. Put simply, Constellation will allow for synthetic testing environments.

During his presentation at AV18, Danny Shapiro, the senior director of automotive for Nvidia, gave a glimpse at what Constellation can do. Want to see how your driverless software operates during those few minutes a day where the glare from the sun is right in the car's sensors?

Instead of driving a few cars in that scenario each day and hoping for optimal conditions, a developer can test that specific scenario thousands of times over and over -- and do so 24/7. With Constellation, the user can manipulate the angle of the sun, add obstacles such as people or cars, alter the weather and go from day to night. There are a near endless amount of scenarios a team of developers can come up with to test their software.

Whew. That's a lot of tech.

Target's Got a Bullseye

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/amazon-target-walmart-online-sales-14691038,"Is Amazon.com (AMZN) gobbling up market share from Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) -- or is that just a retail myth?

With Walmart and Target each posting strong earnings, especially online, in the second quarter, the picture looks a lot more nuanced than what popular narratives may suggest. On Wednesday, Target reported increasing revenue at $17.55 billion for the quarter, driven by a 6.4% increase in traffic and a 41% increase in online sales.

Meanwhile, last week, Walmart also beat revenue expectations and reported an increase of 4.5% in same-store sales, an outcome that also soundly beat analyst projections of 2.3%. Moreover, it reported that its U.S. e-commerce sales grew by 41% in the quarter, although it didn't release specific sales figures.

On Wednesday, Target shares rose 3.2%, Walmart fell 0.4% and Amazon increased 1.1%.

A strong economy is one factor driving a rosy quarter for Target (TGT) , Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) , which also saw bigger-than-ever Prime Day sales and an overall muscular quarter.

""You've got a favorable macro environment; consumers have money to spend and they're spending,"" said Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea.

Another factor: The retailers play in slightly different sandboxes at least for now. As noted by TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa, the customer bases of Walmart and Amazon Prime are meaningfully different. And with e-commerce still accounting for just a relatively small slice of all U.S. retail sales, brick-and-mortar retail still dominates.

""Amazon is dominating online retail, but they're not dominating retail. Amazon's got 20-25% of online spend in the U.S., but online spend is only 15% of all retail sales,"" O'Shea added.

With both Target and Amazon posting strong growth in online sales, should Amazon be worried that primarily offline retailers are catching up? Not necessarily.

It's Amazon that may be playing catch-up, at least in one area: physical stores. The online giant is busy building its offline presence, including Amazon Go, which launched in the Seattle area with plans to expand in other cities; Amazon Books, with 16 physical locations nationwide, and a few dozen pop-up shops selling Amazon devices and other products in the U.S.

""There's a lot of retailers out there that are growing their online businesses massively, a lot growing at a pace faster than Amazon,"" O'Shea added. ""Amazon doesn't have much of a brick-and-mortar presence. That's where the battle is going to be fought in retail.""

What goes up must come down. Or at least some analysts are beginning to think so for Target (TGT) stock, dividing opinion on the street.

Target has posted another quarter of strong growth, bolstered by a 41% rise in its e-commerce business, following the trend of other brick and mortar retailers expanding their digital presence. But the meteoric rise has analysts wary of a pullback.

Target shares were up more than 3% to nearly $86 just minutes before Wednesday's close. They were trading at $67.63 at the beginning of 2018.

""We recognize TGT is delivering on its top-line initiative, but believe the second half guidance is potentially aggressive, particularly given elevated competition and promotions across the industry in the fourth quarter,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note today.

Gutman rated the stock underweight, with a price target of $70, speculating that this could be the peak for the retailer.

Deutsche Bank research analyst Mike Baker was likewise cautious, issuing a hold rating and a price target of $80, also below the mid-day price significantly.

""Flow through was not great with EBIT growth of just $40 million versus sales growth of $1.14 billion,"" he explained. ""This implies an incremental margin of 3.5%.""

Baker also noted the retailer's aggressive posture as a growing concern as the company continues to set higher bars for itself.

""The same store sales bar has now been set higher, making incremental beats from here more difficult,"" he concluded.

Real Money's own James ""Rev Shark"" DePorre also noted that there is concern over the stock falling back down to earth in a similar fashion to its competitor Walmart (WMT) , which shot up over $100 per share after a strong earnings release only to settle around $95 this week.

He suggested selling the stock at this point and waiting for a more amenable entry point.

However, not all analysts were so wary.

Seth Sigman, a research analyst at Credit Suisse, was optimistic on the prospect of the retailer continuing its rise.

""The results should help instill confidence in 2H outlook and TGT's ability to sustain growth even as comparisons get more difficult,"" he wrote in a note today. ""We see TGT stock rising, with signs of higher EPS, balanced omni-channel growth and cheap relative valuation.""

As such, he advised an outperform rating for the stock.

Even still, he was not the most aggressive analyst, as both Baird analyst Peter Benedict and Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes raised their respective price targets to $100 from the previous $90 on the back of the earnings presentation this morning, citing confidence in continued momentum.

As the retailer continues to beat estimates quarter over quarter, analysts are beginning to separate on their forecast for the stock.

Just as Target CEO Brian Cornell divided the retail industry into winners and losers, so too will analysts be divided based on the second half for Target.",,
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/22/2018/jim-cramer-focus-forest-spend,"Jim Cramer: Focus on the Forest of Spend

Maybe we just have it all wrong. Maybe President Trump has so emphasized manufacturing and its importance to the U.S. economy, that we forgot that this nation is a nation based on consumption, not on industry, on sales, not on making things.

It's throwing us off track and this week, with all of these retail sales, especially those related to the home, is producing a lot more positive results in the stock market than people may realize.

Speaking of the President, I don't want to overlook the issues that the twin guilties, the guilty verdict for Paul Manafort and the plea of guilty for Michael Cohen. present for the President.

I indulged earlier about how the political news is hard to gauge when it comes to individual stocks - the JNJ theorem. But let me just say, having just come from a terrific seminar with Mark Chaikin of Chaikin money flow fame, we would be wrong to bet the house on what happens in politics because historically the market has shrugged off political turmoil. Chaikin measured the impact of the Kennedy assassination, the Nixon resignation, Iran Contra during the Reagan years, the Clinton impeachment, and found that all of these were never more than a short-term distraction. He also points out that the near-term downside for President Trump would be the likelihood of the Democrats taking back the house, and, to quote him ""nothing much will get done in Washington after November and the stock market likes that.""

So now let's revert to my thesis of what's wrong with so much prognostication right now. The President dominates the headlines through his appearances and his tweets and when he does it's all about international trade and bringing back manufacturing here. That's a worthy goal. We have lost a lot of manufacturing to overseas.

We are a 19 trillion dollar economy though and two-thirds of it is based on consumer spending. That means we spend way too much time worrying about our trading partners and way too little time talking about what our real economy is about, going to stores and shopping on line for goods and services. Yes, we should care about where cars are made and other countries should have no more tariffs on us than we have on them. You bet we should care about the Chinese stealing our intellectual property and demanding ridiculous joint ventures to steal our secrets and our profits. We sure do wish they bought more of what we make.

But to some degree all of this is a gigantic abstraction.

And that's what we have seen in this remarkable week when we have gotten reports after reports of amazing sales from American retailers, a much more important part of our economy than aluminum tariffs that actually help create at max a couple of thousand jobs. Steel's different; steel is a reviving industry. So I don't want to go down the path of being anti-tariff.

But we have now seen incredible numbers from Target (TGT) , from Lowe's (LOW) , from Urban Outfitters (URBN) , from Kohl's (KSS) and from TJX (TJX) to go with the stellar earnings from Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) .

Target's typical. Analysts were expecting about 3.9% comparable store sales. They came in at 6.5%. The company had incredibly strong traffic both in store and on line with same store sales trends accelerating in all given their core merchandising categories. As Cornell told listeners ""While there are healthy increases across the board, comp growth in our home category was amazingly strong, up nearly ten percent. Hardlines also saw high single digit comp growth driven by strength in both toys and electronics.""

All of this bounty isn't just limited to Target though. As CEO Brian Cornell pointed out ""like others we're currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I have seen in my career.""

Now Cornell did address tariffs pointing out that he is ""well aware"" that things could escalate and that ""we are concerned about tariffs because they would increase prices on everyday products for American families."" He's not oblivious: ""a prolonged deterioration in global trade relationships could damage economic growth and vitality in the United States.""

But the real takeaway of all of these numbers from Target and just about every other retailer save J.C. Penney (JCP) is that the analysts who follow major parts of this economy have been dead wrong about their views of the consumer and of retail.

Whether it be a fear of Amazon (AMZN) , or a sense that the press about Trump has created an aura of negativity, or whether it be endless concerns about the Chinese, they have missed the boat, they are almost all playing catch-up, hence the smashing of consensus numbers.

I have some theories about why they are so wrong. Let me share them. First, as Home Depot's Carol Tome, the best CFO there is, told us, just because there's no real housing turnover doesn't meant there are issues in spending itself. The spend for refurbishing and renovation is off the charts, something that Marvin Ellison, in a brilliant introductory conference call now that he runs Lowe's made abundantly clear. The spend there is incredible.

No wonder Home Depot's stock is up seven from where it plummeted after the quarter. If you listen to Target or Walmart or Lowe's you know that the spend has surged on peoples' homes and apartments. I am sure when Best Buy (BBY) reports next week we will hear the same thing.

Second reason they missed? We were way into the Death Star just when Amazon was into web services and advertising.

I have total respect for Amazon. It is the largest position by far in my charitable trust which you can follow along by joining the Action Alerts PLUS club. But the fact is that Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods is beginning to look like a big fake out. They haven't disrupted the food industry, hence the huge romp in Kroger's (KR) stock. They haven't disrupted the discounter world as we can tell from Walmart, Target and Kohl's. Amazon hasn't dented the off-price business, which is why Burlington (BURL) , Ross (ROST) , Five Below (FIVE) and TJX have stocks that won't quit and just go higher and higher. Amazon really hasn't hurt CVS (CVS) as nearly as we thought and it is merging with Aetna (AET) anyway. Walgreen's (WBA) business is unimpaired, too. We know now that the do it yourself business, whether it be Costco (COST) or Home Depot or Lowe's or AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) , hasn't been zapped by the Death Star either.

In the face of a robust consumer who is benefiting from a torrid job market and lower taxes, Amazon can't crush all but the most hobbled of companies, like a Toys R Us or a Bon-Ton or Sears-Kmart (SHLD) and, perhaps ultimately a J.C. Penney. And unlike all the big retailers I have mentioned none of those companies had the balance sheet to compete as all the remaining store chains of rock-solid finances.

Finally, sorry, I have to go there: we have to talk millennials because they may be the most misunderstood cohort that simply isn't being factored in to retail sales.

We know from Victor Luis, the unbelievably good CEO of Tapestry (TPR) , that millennials love to spend to distinguish themselves and footwear and handbags allow millennials to express and individualize in a way that a fuddy duddy old analysts would never understand. We know from Target that millennials love to fix up their apartments, that's what is behind the incredible growth of their amazing small store format. We know from Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take Two Interactive (TTWO) , that millennials just spend and spend on video games of all varieties. Do you know that one of the reasons we are such big fans of the stock of Nvidia (NVDA) , the chip maker, is that their brand new, just released Graphics Processing Unit makes video game images look exactly like that of the movies. There could be a tidal wave of new boxes and downloaded videos

These spending decisions matter. They are much bigger than what the President wants with China and our steel or even our technology. They are more determinant than Cohen/Manafort. And perhaps most important, they are the real narrative that helps you make money, not the Fed, not the ten year, not the inverted yield curve, not President XI, and not soybean and sock tariffs or corrupt Facebook (FB) pages. We have to focus on the forest of spend, not the trees of trade and then we can make the big money.",,

Target Corporation (TGT) is looking to take over market segments vacated by ""losers"" in the retail industry like the recently shuttered Toys R Us franchise, turning its focus to the toy and baby market as the calendar speeds ahead towards the holiday season.

CEO Brian Cornell explained that the company has and will continue to poach on the market share left over from ailing or defunct retailers.

""There are clearly winners and losers,"" he said on the earnings call on Wednesday. ""We think we are migrating toward the winners' column.""

He even called Toy's R Us and Babies R Us out by name, as the market gap left behind by their ""losing out"" will be an area the company will continue to target.

Toys R Us declared bankruptcy in September 2017, shutting down around 800 stores in June.

""As companies like Toys R Us and Babies R Us exit the market, we have the opportunity to gain that market share,"" he explained, building upon his statement that ""both toys and babies are key categories for [the company] and we expect to see continued growth.""

For context, even the ailing Toys R' Us was able to generate over $7 billion in sales in its final year of business, 36% of which came from the sale of baby products.

Analysts were inclined to agree that this area posed a unique opportunity for a retailer like Target.

""In the first quarter, TGT had strategically increased inventory within the toys and baby categories to take advantage of Toys R Us closings,"" Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman wrote in a note this morning. ""We expect a meaningful impact from incremental sales in these categories during the second half.""

Inventory overall increased 7% for the business in the second quarter, down from 9% in the first quarter.

To be sure, this will not be a one-horse race, as Walmart (WMT) has been open about its race to fill the same market gap leftover from Babies R Us and Toys R Us.

Specifically for babies, Walmart has been revamping its website in order to take advantage of the market gap and further to help fend off Amazon's (AMZN) advance on the Babies R Us customer base.

In an announcement posted to its website late last month, the company announced a ""broader commitment to baby online"", adding 30,000 baby-targeted items to its catalog in order to help it gain market share in the nearly $74 billion industry.

Increasing competition from Walmart and Amazon, both in toys and babies and more broadly, is something that Target CEO Brian Cornell thinks about every day.

With billions of dollars are up for grabs in the niche market, it is clear to see why.",,Walmart

Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell tells me the company's efforts in same-day delivery and ship from store are giving it a huge advantage in the battle with online foes like Amazon (AMZN) . Cornell didn't go as far as to say Target and rival Walmart (WMT) have cracked the retail code of successfully integrating physical stores with digital stores, but hinted his outfit is coming close.

And the numbers prove it.

Target posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 for the second quarter on Wednesday, which handily beat Wall Street expectations of $1.40. The company's 6.4% increase in traffic growth is the strongest number it has posted since it started reporting the metric in 2008.

It also announced comparable sales growth of 6.5%, which is the largest increase in 13 years. Wall Street anticipated a 3.9% increase.

Online sales spiked 41% from the prior year.

Walmart was no slouch in the second quarter either, notching 4.5% U.S. same-store sales growth. Similar to Target, Walmart benefited from initiatives to fuse online and physical store shopping.

Target Corporation (TGT) jumped 5.6% at 9:59 a.m. in New York, after its same-store sales rose by the largest percentage in a decade and the retailer said it can keep the momentum going.

The 116-year-old, Minnesota-based company reported $17.8 billion in revenue for the second quarter, beating estimates by $500 million, and earnings per share of $1.47 against a $1.40 estimate, leading one analyst to call the results ""glorious"".

The momentum established in the past year is remarkable, as revenue rang in at $16.4 billion just a year ago, but room to grow remains according to CEO Brian Cornell.

""We laid out a clear strategy at the beginning of 2017, and throughout this year we've been accelerating the pace of execution,"" he said in a release announcing the earnings results. ""We're on track to deliver a strong back half and we've updated our full year guidance to reflect the strength of our business and the consumer economy.""

In fact, he told CNBC this morning that the company is ""going to do the same thing in the second half as the first half,"" continuing to set a high mark.

The new targets will be lofty ones to shoot for, as comparable sales growth of 6.5% and traffic growth of 6.4% were reported for the company valued at over $45 billion.

Yet the challenges remain for the company as it will continue to compete with giants such as Walmart (WMT) in brick and mortar stores and Action Alerts PLUS holding Amazon (AMZN) for online retail.

Further trade battles with China and tariffs on imports pose a risk to Target as it attempts to maintain competitive prices.

Cornell downplayed the concern in an interview with CNBC this morning, noting the ""flexibility and agility"" of Target's business model as equipping the retailer to deal with challenges as they arrive.

Tariffs will be front and center for the retail industry Wednesday as Stephen Lamar of the American Apparel & Footwear Association and Karen Giberson of the Accessories Council will be speaking at U.S.-China tariff hearing, discussing the trade war and its impact on clothing retail.

The company's earnings call will be broadcast at 8 a.m. ET this morning and analysts will certainly be eager to hear how the company can replicate its record growth as the macroeconomic landscape changes.

""We laid out a clear strategy at the beginning of 2017, and throughout this year we've been accelerating the pace of execution,"" Cornell told analysts on the call. ""We're on track to deliver a strong back half and we've updated our full year guidance to reflect the strength of our business and the consumer economy.""",,

What differentiates earnings' results posted by Kohl's Corporation (KSS) and TJX Companies Inc (TJX) from Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) ?

Capturing the coveted millennial customer base is one clue.

After a week of retail earnings highlighted by the triumphs of TJX and Kohl's contrasted with the stumbles of Macy's and J.C. Penney, an appeal to a younger demographic of consumers appears to be a good barometer of success.

Despite its slight drop this morning, Kohl's shares rose 1.7% on Tuesday after market close and gained over 100% in the past year, while TJX built on an already great calendar year by gaining nearly 5% in trading today after its earnings release.

""We are particularly pleased that we have been attracting a significant share of millennial and Gen Z shoppers among our new customers at each of our divisions,"" TJX Companies CEO Ernie Herrman said. ""Importantly, the majority of new customers at Marmaxx are these younger customers which indeed bodes very well for our future.""

Marmaxx is a subsidiary of TJX.

TJX Companies has been the most significant grower in the retail space on the back of this expanded and accelerating consumer base, growing revenue by nearly 20% over the past four years.

Even more remarkably, it has done so without a truly concerted push into digital, which Herrman called ""a small piece"" of the overall business in the earnings presentation today.

Kohl's, while still growing its appeal to younger shoppers, has embraced e-commerce and online retail to attract younger consumers.

It has also spearheaded millennial trends through partnerships with the likes of Lauren Conrad, actress and entrepreneur, and her signature LC Lauren Conrad Denim Collection for Kohl's. Conrad, 32 years old, has actively listened to customer feedback to design her collection.

Contrast that with J.C. Penney's broad focus on women and middle-aged moms, and it's clear Kohl's has a much more specific idea of what their customer wants.

During this morning's earnings call, Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass reported ""mid-teens"" growth in online sales, 50% of which were mobile sales.

Further the company has partnered with online retail king Amazon (AMZN) , forming a symbiotic relationship with the space's biggest fish rather than becoming prey.

By comparison, legacy companies Macy's and JC Penney shares were battered on their earnings, accelerating the decline for the struggling retailers. JC Penney dipped as much as 23% on the news of a poor quarter on earnings last Thursday, while Macy's shares fell off by 13% on Wednesday.

Each company has its own struggles, with debt and leadership issues at JC Penney, however the lack of appeal to younger consumers is choking the company's consumer base as well.

Both companies were grilled by analysts on their inability to generate meaningful growth in digital sales despite strong, stated efforts and investments into online retail.

Despite a strong consumer backdrop, JCP had disappointing same-store sales, which includes a negative trend in digital sales, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy wrote in a note on August 16 detailing her primary problems with J.C. Penney.

Macy's, while escaping the harsh criticism directed at J.C .Penney due to its strong calendar year so far, has fallen significantly in revenue figures since 2014, leaving its stock just over 50% from its peak value in 2015.

Adding to their problem in millennial market share is TJX, which is poaching its preferred new customers.

Macy's CEO told Washington Post 70% of millennials shop at off-price retailers each month and the company ""needed to solve for that"", cutting prices specifically to appeal to this demographic. However, as noted, TJ Maxx is simply outpacing Macy's in cultivating this market segment.

As such, while TJ Maxx revenues have grown nearly 20% since 2014, Macy's have fallen by about 9%.

As the struggling retailers look to recover from a comparatively difficult earnings release, it seems their future lies in paying more attention to millennial customers.",,TJX

Kohl's also increased its guidance for fiscal 2018, saying it now expects adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.55. Previously, it had expected adjusted earnings of $5.05 to $5.50 a share. Analysts estimate adjusted EPS of $5.39.

Same-store sales grew 3.1% in the second quarter, beating estimates of 2.6%.

""Kohl's posted a solid second quarter, benefiting from solid inventory management with inventories per store down approximately 8% and gross margins up 42 basis points,"" said Christina Boni, a Moody's vice president. ""The major department stores that have performed well have continued to focus on speed to market and inventory efficiency, which are critical to improving the customer experience as well as profitability.""

When asked by an analyst about how the partnership with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) was going, CEO Michelle Gass responded, ""So, we've been in this pilot now for about nine months ... for both parties, we're really pleased with the partnership ... and customer response.""

""We feel really good about the customer experience that we've created,"" said Gass. She also noted that Kohl's was ready to see how Milwaukee customers responded to the partnership. With the expansion, Kohl's has more than 100 stores that offer free Amazon returns.

""This is a big deal for us and Amazon ... we want to make sure that we optimize and get it right,"" said Gass. ""It's a frictionless experience. We're getting really great feedback from customers. You know, all elements have to work ... before any decisions are made.""

The concept comprises a wind farm with 11 wind turbines based on Equinor's floating offshore wind concept, Hywind. The 8-megawatt turbines would have a combined capacity of 88 megawatts, and meet about 35% of the annual power demand of the five platforms: Snorre A and B, and Gullfaks A, B and C.

""Reducing the use of gas turbines by supplying platforms with power from floating offshore wind is a challenging and innovative project,"" said Equinor's executive vice president for new energy solutions, Pal Eitrheim. ""It may also facilitate new industrial opportunities for Norway, Equinor and Norwegian supply industry within profitable renewable energy, while enabling oil and gas production with low CO2 emissions.""

Equinor said the preliminary capital and development expenditures of the project total about 5 billion Norwegian kronor ($600 million), but the industry's NOx fund will provide up to NOK566 million in investment support. Equinor will also apply to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, which has a fund to assist in new renewable energy projects.

The seven Snorre and Gullfaks partners will now mature the project toward a possible investment decision in 2019.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/santos-restarts-dividends-after-return-to-profit-2018-08-23,"MELBOURNE, Australia--Santos Ltd. (STO.AU) restarted dividend payments after swinging back to a half-year profit following two years of action to revive a balance sheet stressed by hefty bets on gas-export projects from Australia to Papua New Guinea.

The annual result came less than a day after Santos unveiled a US$2.15 billion deal to buy natural-gas company Quadrant Energy, part of a strategy to build out its presence near existing infrastructure and diversify its mainly oil-linked revenues.

Santos suspended dividends in 2016 when slumping oil prices forced it to focus on slashing debt that by the end of prior year had swollen to about US$4.7 billion. However, with oil prices rebounding to a four-year high during the company's fiscal first half, management are again seeking to balance shareholder returns with growth opportunities.

Santos recorded a net profit of US$104 million for the first half of the year against a year-earlier loss of US$506 million when it absorbed impairment charges against the value of its assets. Stripping out one-time items, underlying earnings roughly doubled year-over-year to US$217 million as revenue increased to US$1.68 billion from US$1.45 billion.

For the first-half, the board approved a dividend payment of 3.5 cents a share.

Since taking over as chief executive in early 2016, Kevin Gallagher has sold off a string of assets to tie Santos's future to the GLNG gas-export operation in east Australia that counts Total SA among its partners, the Exxon Mobil-led PNG LNG operation in Papua New Guinea, the Darwin LNG project in northern Australia and assets including in the Cooper Basin straddling South Australia and Queensland states.

The company's struggles weighed heavily on its share price the past two years, attracting takeover approaches the company has rebuffed as too low. The latest came in May when Santos rejected a more than US$10 billion takeover offer from private equity-backed Harbour Energy Ltd. that was pitched at the equivalent of A$6.95 a share, a level Santos last traded at in mid-2015 despite coming near earlier this month.

However, Wednesday's agreement to buy Quadrant Energy signals a desire to balance debt repayments with finding opportunities for growth. Quadrant holds more than 52,000 square kilometers (20,077 square miles) of natural-gas and oil acreage, mainly in the Carnarvon Basin offshore of Western Australia state. Santos estimates savings of US$30 million to US$50 million a year from merging the businesses.

The deal will include possible royalty payments tied to future production from the Bedout Basin off Western Australia, where Quadrant recently reported the sizeable Dorado-1 oil discovery.

Brookfield Business Partners and its institutional partners control roughly 48% of Quadrant, while Macquarie Capital, part of the financial-services company Macquarie Group, and its institutional partners control about 22%. The rest is held directly or indirectly by Wesfarmers Ltd., AMB Holdings and Quadrant management.

Santos's production was just over 5% lower in the half year at 28 million barrels of oil equivalent after output from the PNG LNG operation was dented by a big earthquake in Papua New Guinea and planned shutdowns in Australia. Still, the company benefited from a 37% jump in the average realized oil price over the period.

It reaffirmed targeted output for the full year of between 55 million and 58 million barrels and sales volumes of 72 million-76 million barrels.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-companies-sales-growth-is-accelerating-here-are-the-biggest-winners-2018-08-08,"Updated to add raw revenue growth to the tables.

As we near the end of earnings season, two trends are clear: Profits have gone through the roof, helped by lower corporate income taxes. But sales have also increased remarkably, and that trend started before the tax cuts went into effect.

About 18% of S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% companies have fiscal quarter-end dates that don’t match the end dates of calendar quarters. Also, through Aug. 7, about 95% of S&P 500 companies had reported results for fiscal quarters ended April 27 or later.

But that’s close enough for us to show a set of remarkable numbers. According to the most recently available quarterly data through Aug. 7, 267 S&P 500 companies increased their sales per share by 10% or more from a year earlier. Here’s the data going back eight quarters:

Quarter Number of S&P 500 companies showing increases in sales per share of 10% or more from year-earlier quarter Q2 2018 267 Q1 2018 253 Q4 2017 249 Q3 2017 189 Q2 2017 174 Q1 2017 196 Q4 2016 176 Q3 2016 165 Quarterly data through Aug. 7, 2018, subject to revision. Source: FactSet

That’s a pretty clear trend, and you can see a big move from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter. The partial recovery of oil prices played a part. (West Texas crude oil CL1, -0.57% hit a high of $107.68 a barrel in June 2014 and fell to a low of $26.05 in Feb. 2016 before recovering to $60.41 at the end of 2017 and closing at $69.17 on Aug. 7.)

We have been looking at sales per share, rather than raw revenue, because a company’s sales might jump because of the acquisition of another large company. Acquisitions are often funded in whole or in part by the issuance of new shares by the acquiring company. So the per-share numbers can give a better indication of whether or not a merger was “worth it” to the acquiring company’s shareholders.

While the per-share numbers reflect any dilution from the issuance of stock for any reason, they are also boosted by the repurchase of shares, which is an important trend that shows no signs of letting up.

So while the tables below are sorted by increases in sales per share, we have added another column showing how much raw revenue increased.

Second-quarter sales winners

Here are the 37 S&P 500 companies (nearly half are energy companies) that increased their sales per share by 25% or more for their most recent reported quarters through Aug. 8, while also showing improved gross profit margins:

You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including news, earnings coverage and other financials, charts, estimates and price ratios.

A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It doesn’t incorporate overhead expenses but is useful when considering the quality of a company’s core business. If sales growth comes as a result of a significant lowering of prices in the face of competition, the trend is not sustainable. It’s a good sign if a company’s sales are growing rapidly while its gross margin is widening.

FactSet doesn’t provide gross margin numbers for banks and insurance companies, which use other measures of profitability for their products and services. So here are the six S&P 500 financial-services companies that showed increases in sales per share of 25% or more for the second quarter:

Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.34% became the first U.S.-listed company in history to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization on Thursday.

The ongoing, and long-running, bull market has been led by huge gains in the stocks of big-name tech behemoths. And Apple’s historic feat — while, yes, just another stat for the history books — can be viewed as the ultimate symbol of Big Tech’s rise over the American corporate icons of old: U.S. Steel, General Electric, Exxon, Wal-Mart.

U.S. Steel X, -0.16% , generally cited as the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $1 billion market capitalization, cleared the milestone immediately upon going public in 1901.

The history of these market-cap distinctions, viewed over time, paints a historical portrait of America’s changing corporate landscape — from the dominance of industrials for most of the 20th century, to the dawn of the tech era in the latter decades of the century, to today’s dominance of technology companies (and Apple’s freshly minted $1 trillion valuation).

The first $100 billion U.S. company

First, a few historical notes: IBM IBM, +0.33% is sometimes identified as the first publicly listed U.S. company to reach the $100 billion milestone, doing so on Aug. 20, 1987. However, IBM never closed above that threshold, according to FactSet’s data analysis.

Meanwhile, the old AT&T Corp. T, -0.38% (before it was acquired by SBC Communications, which then took the AT&T name, in 2005) closed above $100 billion in November 1992, according to FactSet market-cap tracking. However, the Dow Jones Market Data Group was not able to independently confirm that number when calculating the market cap manually using historical share counts and share pricing on that date. This may be as a result of corporate actions taken by the company in 2005, but it appears the available data leave room for doubt at this milestone level.

AFP/Getty Images Pictured from left at an NYSE ceremony marking the centennial of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in May 1996 are the exchange’s then-chairman, Richard Grasso; then–Dow Jones CEO Peter Kahn; Jack Welch, then the CEO of General Electric; and a man dressed as Dow Jones co-founder Charles Henry Dow. The opening bell was rung by Welch, in recognition of the fact that GE was, at that time, the only surviving company among the 12 listed in the first average. GE was removed as a Dow component this June.

Which brings us to General Electric GE, -0.20% circa 1995. U.S. stocks were about halfway through the bull market that began in the early 1990s and ended with the dot-com bust of 2000. On Sept. 14, 1995, GE crossed the $100 billion mark, making it the first officially recorded to have done so.

The industrial conglomerate, in many ways, had the kind of stock success story in the 20th century that Apple is having in the 21st.

Recently, however, GE’s stock has come upon harder times. In June, GE was booted as a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -0.84% , after having been a component of the Dow average at its 1896 inception and having retained a roster spot for the past 111 straight years.

The managing director of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices said of the move: “The U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today, and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.”

GE’s market cap currently stands at about $114.5 billion.

The first $500 billion U.S. company

Getty Images Bill Gates, then chairman and CEO of Microsoft, gestures toward a handheld device running Microsoft Windows during a keynote address at a 1999 convention in Las Vegas.

On July 16, 1999, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.87% became the first U.S. company to reach a market cap of $500 billion. It stayed above $500 billion for just two trading sessions, before dipping back below that level. This was, of course, the heyday of the dot-com boom. Stocks were hitting record heights as solid quarterly reports and sky’s-the-limit forecasts rolled in. The day Microsoft hit $500 billion in value, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% notched a third consecutive record finish. Shares of the software company climbed 5.4% that day to a then-record high of $99.44, on expectations that it was close to creating a separate stock to track its Microsoft Network business.

Microsoft actually went on to again hit $500 billion in market value, and then surpass it to reach $607 billion in market cap, in December 1999. But in the spring of 2000, the bubble popped — and Microsoft finished that year with a market cap of $231 billion.

Today, the stock is experiencing a resurgence, and its market cap sits at about $818 billion, the fourth highest among U.S. companies.

The first $1 trillion U.S. company

Apple’s $1 trillion milestone came after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. The company also delivered an upbeat forecast for its September quarter, when it typically releases new iPhone models. In a concerted two-day push to $1 trillion, Apple added $82 billion in market value.

Don’t miss: Apple makes history with $1 trillion market cap, but take a look at what happened to the first company to get there

The build-up to $1 trillion wasn’t without drama. When Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.48% reported earnings last week and saw its stock jump, some — including a majority of MarketWatch readers participating in an informal poll — thought the company would beat Apple to the trillion-dollar punch. Amazon’s market capitalization now sits at roughly $873 billion, ahead of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.05% GOOG, +0.94% , with its $849 million market cap.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, for his part, is downplaying the $1 trillion milestone, saying it’s “not the most important measure of our success.” Not to mention co-founder Steve Wozniak, who put it like this: “Of course I’m proud of Apple, but I don’t measure the world by human simplifications like round numbers. A company is great because it is great.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/probe-of-exxons-climate-change-investor-disclosures-dropped-by-sec-2018-08-03,"Securities regulators have dropped an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil Corp. misled investors about the risks that climate change and greenhouse-gas regulations posed to its business.

The Securities and Exchange Commission informed Exxon XOM, +0.17% that it closed the probe — and decided against trying to penalize the energy giant over its disclosures and how it accounted for oil and gas assets, according to a letter reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

Exxon in a statement confirmed the probe had ended, saying it began in January 2016 and involved more than 4.2 million pages of records. “After a thorough investigation, including a review of these documents, the SEC issued its closure letter,” company spokesman Scott Silvestri said.

The decision ends what was a surprise foray by the SEC into questioning a major oil producer’s communications to investors about climate change and related regulations.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bp-profit-shoots-up-boosted-by-higher-oil-prices-2018-07-31,"LONDON -- BP PLC on Tuesday said second-quarter profit jumped, as higher oil prices helped the company accelerate ambitious growth plans.

London-based BP said its replacement cost profit -- a number analogous to the net income that U.S. oil companies report -- tripled to $1.8 billion in the second quarter, compared with $600 million in the same period a year earlier.

After years of cost-cutting and financial restructuring when oil prices slumped, BP and other big oil companies are benefiting from a recovery in the market. Oil prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, allowing companies to generate higher profit and cash flow. Brent crude prices averaged nearly $75 a barrel from April to June, compared with an average of roughly $50 a barrel in the same three months last year.

Last week, BP announced a $10.5 billion deal to acquire some of the hottest assets in U.S. shale country. The acquisition is the company's biggest in 20 years and signals its growing confidence. At the same time, the company also said it would increase its dividend for the second quarter by 2.5%.

The numbers bear out BP's ambitious plan to regain its position among the elite tier of big energy companies following its fatal blowout in the Gulf of Mexico eight years ago. The company's production rose 3% in the first half of the year compared with the same period a year ago, delivering on a strategy to return to its former size by the early 2020s.

""I can't remember when it has looked this good,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said.

Still, payments related to the 2010 disaster remain a financial drag. BP's landmark $20 billion settlement with the U.S. government in 2015 requires the company to make annual payments of around $1 billion through the end of the next decade. Payments in 2018 are expected to total just over $3 billion after tax.

BP caps off a mixed earnings season for the world's biggest oil companies. The likes of Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC all posted sharply higher profits, but failed to impress investors who had expected even bigger windfalls.

PwC has earned $10.74 million since 2013, according to the Senate’s lobbying disclosure database, as the exclusive registered lobbyist for the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, on a single issue: tax reform.

Federal securities laws require auditors to be independent of, including prohibiting auditors from serving in an “advocacy role” for audit clients. Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act states “an accountant is not independent whenever, during the audit and professional engagement period, the accountant . . . acts as an advocate for the audit client.”

Former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner told MarketWatch, “This is a clear-cut violation of auditor independence. Investor confidence in the reliability of a corporation’s financial statements depends upon the public’s perception of the outside auditor as an independent professional. If they see the auditor advocating for the client, the value of the audit itself could be lost.”

A spokeswoman for PwC declined comment on the contract with the Alliance for Corporate Taxation.

MarketWatch did not receive a response to an email to the Alliance requesting comment.

Spokeswomen for the SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the audit industry regulator, also declined comment on the PwC contract with the Alliance.

In 2014 fellow Big 4 audit firm Ernst & Young agreed to pay $4 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it violated auditor independence rules after Reuters reported that its lobbying arm, known as Washington Council Ernst & Young, had ongoing lobbying contracts with companies it also audited.

Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told MarketWatch, “There are serious conflict of interest issues when an auditor has a lucrative side project involving its clients, very much along the lines of the consulting fees that created so much trouble in the Enron era.”",2018-07-30,IBM
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-tech-stocks-hint-at-rebound-ahead-of-gdp-twitter-results-2018-07-27,"U.S. stocks closed lower Friday following disappointing results from Twitter Inc. and bellwethers, including Exxon and Intel. The highly-anticipated release of gross domestic product data also showed that economic growth remains relatively strong but came in a shade below lofty expectations.

How did the main benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% slid 76.01 points, or 0.3%, to 25,451.06. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% shed 18.62 points, or 0.7%, to 2,818.82 with seven of its 11 sectors lower as the technology sector sank 2%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% fell 114.77 points, or 1.5%, to 7,737.42.

For the week, the Dow added 1.6%, the S&P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq fell 1.1%. Both the Dow and the S&P posted their fourth straight weekly gains, the longest such streak since January.

What drove the markets?

Consumers and government spending powered the economy to a 4.1% rate of gross domestic product growth in the second quarter, the fastest pace of growth in almost four years, although it was slightly below the 4.2% rate predicted, on average, by economists surveyed by MarketWatch.

President Donald Trump called the report “amazing” and “very sustainable.” Economists, on the other hand, said this pace of expansion wasn’t likely to last.

Separately, consumer sentiment fell to a six-month low in July, the University of Michigan said, but came inslightly better than expected.

In a bright spot for company news, Amazon.comInc. AMZN, +1.48% gained 0.5% after the e-commerce company posted not only its biggest quarterly profit in history, but earnings that were double what was expected. The company extended its strong year-to-date rally and hit new records. It is up 55% thus far in 2018, playing a key role in boosting the market.

Amazon’s results could soothe concerns about the state of the FAANG trade. That refers to five large-capitalization internet and technology stocks—Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google’s parent Alphabet—that have supported the market for years. While Alphabet reported strong results, Netflix disappointed earlier this season. Facebook revealed slowing user growth and weak guidance, sparking its biggest one-day percentage drop ever on Thursday, a collapse that wiped out about $120 billion in market value.

On the political front, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, said Trump knew in advance about a summer 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between top campaign staffers, including his son, Donald Trump Jr., and Russians said to be offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton, according to a CNN report late Thursday.

What were analysts saying?

“A strong GDP number—and 4.1% is still a good number, even if it was a bit below consensus—will signal that the Fed can continue with its plan for rate increases. That will be top of mind for investors today,” said Chad Oviatt, director of investment management for Huntington Private Bank.

“We remain fairly constructive about equities. Generally speaking there’s a lot of confidence about earnings growth, and the number of firms that are meeting or beating expectations, even in light of names like Facebook,” he said.

Which other stocks were in focus?

Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.17% fell 2.8% after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed expectations. Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.32% also came in below forecasts, but its shares shook off an initial decline to rise 1.6%. Both stocks are Dow components.

Also weighing on the Dow was Intel Corp. INTC, -0.19% which sank 8.6% after the chip giant’s earnings, revenue and upbeat outlook surpassed Wall Street forecasts late Thursday, but quarterly revenue growth for its best-growing segment fell short of expectations.

Facebook Inc. FB, -0.46% extended losses after having its worst day on Thursday to fall 0.8% in the wake of its subdued outlook. However, Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintained a buy rating on the stock and cut her 12-month price target to $205 from $225.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/exxon-is-getting-punished-as-profit-disappoints-2018-07-27,"A positive attribute of Exxon Mobil Corp. shares may have turned into a liability Friday on the heels of the energy giant’s quarterly earnings miss.

Exxon’s XOM, +0.17% stock is often cited as a “safer” investment in energy, since the company’s large chemicals and refining businesses insulate it against volatility on the oil and gas exploration and production side.

On Friday, however, those defensive characteristics also meant the company missed the boat on rising oil prices. The shares fell nearly 4% after earnings results and were poised to end at their lowest in a month. The losses would snap a four-day winning streak for the shares.

Exxon earlier Friday said it earned $3.95 billion, or 92 cents a share, in the second quarter, up from $3.350 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $73.501 billion from $58.077 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected EPS of $1.27 and revenue of $74.153 billion.

Oil futures US:CLU8 have lost 6% in July, but that comes after an 11% bump in June. So far this year, futures prices have gained 15%, coming off 12% gains in 2017 and 45% in 2016.

The miss came complete with cash flow and production shortcomings.

Exxon notched its seventh cash flow miss in the past 10 quarters, and the third in a row, said analysts at Goldman Sachs. Production was another negative: Second-quarter production numbers were 6% lower than first quarter’s and 7% lower than second-quarter 2017’s. Refining and was among the few brighter spots.

Exxon pinned the miss on “significant scheduled maintenance undertaken to support operational integrity” as well as “extended” recovery time from “operational incidents” that plagued its first quarter and weaker gas demand in Europe.

Silver linings included the return to normal liquefied natural gas operations in Papua New Guinea, a massive project that had been hampered by an earthquake; Exxon’s refining operations; and domestic oil production growth.

“Exxon’s ultra-defensive characteristics (including a significant overweight in downstream and chemicals) inherently limit leverage to oil prices,” analysts at Raymond James said in a note Friday.

“Since we expect further oil price gains to cyclical highs over the next six to 12 months, Exxon stands out as one of the least appealing ways to play that among its peers – and the production trend is also subpar,” they said.

Second-quarter results will keep weighing on the shares, as it continues “a recent trend of rather large earnings misses, and we believe investors may begin to question the through-cycle profitability strength once held by the company,” analysts at Barclays said in a note.

The share weakness came as the energy subsector was third lowest on the S&P 500 index on Friday.

Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.32% the only other publicly traded domestic integrated oil company, also missed estimates on Friday. Chevron reported earnings of $1.78 a share on revenue of $42.24 billion; the FactSet consensus called for EPS of $2.09 on sales of $45.65 billion.

Chevron shares shook off early weakness to gain 1.5% later Friday. Wall Street rewarded Chevron stock despite the earnings miss because that misstep was mainly driven by weakness in international exploration and production, and international refining.

Also helping was Chevron’s announcement of a $3 billion share buyback plan, “demonstrating the company’s constructive outlook for free cash flow generation going forward,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note Friday.

Exxon shares have lost 2.4% so far this year, but have held on to a 9% advance in the past 12 months. That performance compares with 2018 gains of 5.2% and 2.8% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% and advances of 14% and 17% for the benchmarks in the last 12 months.

That’s why some fund-management firms have started “index-plus” funds, which essentially replicate the benchmarks for most of their holdings. The secret sauce is stock selection around the edges in an attempt to outperform the benchmark but, more importantly, never underperform.

T. Rowe Price Group’s TROW, -0.79% version of such a fund is the $720 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity Fund PRCOX, +0.03% overseen by Ann Holcomb and three other portfolio managers. In an interview July 24, she explained that a total of $28 billion is managed, mostly for institutional clients, using the fund’s “index-plus” strategy.

The fund has a five-star rating, the highest, from fund-research firm Morningstar. Over the past three and five years, the fund has performed within the top 10% of funds in Morningstar’s large-blend category. For 10 and 15 years, it has performed within the top 20%. Holcomb has been involved with the fund in various capacities for almost 20 years.

A team of about 30 analysts covering large-cap sectors and industries selects the stocks held by the fund. As of June 30, the fund had 258 equity positions. That is very high, especially for a five-star-rated fund, running counter to the concentrated strategies (selecting fewer than 50 stocks) used by many managers of highly rated funds. Holcomb said that, in effect, the analysts are “managing subportfolios,” while the four portfolio managers “look at things holistically.”

T. Rowe Price Ann Holcomb, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.

While the fund’s strategy is built upon the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.14% it typically holds between 30 and 50 stocks that are not part of the index, and these can include non-U.S. stocks, Holcomb said. Individual stock weightings in the portfolio are limited to 1 percentage point more than the benchmark index’s weight. This means if a large company makes up 2% of the S&P 500, that stock can make up as much as 3% of the fund’s portfolio.

So the idea of the fund is to use an active strategy for a “core holding.” This means a relatively conservative strategy to reduce risk, while remaining broadly diversified, for a large portion of a portfolio. On the institutional side, Holcomb said some clients use the strategy for large portions of target-date funds, which have become popular within 401(k) and similar retirement accounts.

Outperformance

There has been a big movement toward index funds in recent years for the simple reason that most actively managed mutual fund managers have been unable beat their benchmark indexes.

“We just came out of pretty challenging times for stock picking in general,” Holcomb said. “The low-rate environment was pretty difficult across the board for active managers.”

She thinks better times are in store for active stock pickers because the Federal Reserve has been removing some liquidity from the market by raising interest rates and reversing the massive expansion of its balance sheet.

That change may underlie what Holcomb described as “a renewed interest in the strategy” over the past 18 months, with new money coming in after outflows from T. Rowe Price’s “index-plus” strategy.

Here’s how the T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity Fund has performed against its Morningstar category, the S&P 500 Index and two large S&P 500 index funds, as well as two large S&P 500 exchange traded funds.

Total return - 2018 through July 24 Average annual return - 3 years Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years Average return - 15 years T.

A direct comparison to the S&P 500 Index isn’t a fair one, because the index doesn’t charge expenses they way a mutual fund or ETF does. All the other returns on the chart are net of expenses.

The average returns for the T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity Fund have beaten those of the index as well as the index funds and ETFs shown above. Some of these differences appear small, but they add up over time. Here’s a five-year chart showing total returns for the group through July 24:

FactSet

Again the T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity Fund has beaten the index, index funds and ETFs. So with arguably lower risk, because of the human involvement in a fund with more than 250 stocks, the fund’s return has been nearly 3% higher than any of the two second-place performers. Again, that is not a spectacular difference, but it is significant. PRCOX, +0.03%

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's advisers are prodding Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as the oil company is officially known, to raise debt to buy a controlling stake in a petrochemical company from the country's sovereign-wealth fund, said Saudi officials and executives familiar with the talks.

A potential deal would give the Public Investment Fund between $50 billion and $70 billion for all or part of its stake in Saudi Basic Industries Co., officials and executives said. Controlled by the state, Sabic is the country's largest publicly listed company, with a market capitalization of about $100 billion.

That sum is roughly what the sovereign-wealth fund had expected to reap from Aramco's plan to go public. Preparations for an IPO have stalled amid doubts about the company's and country's readiness to handle the scrutiny that accompanies a public listing of shares.

Aramco has already begun seeking billions of dollars in loans from international banks to finance the Sabic deal, according to people familiar with the matter. That debt could be lent in three parts, with the first tranche of up to $10 billion likely to be raised this year, these people said.

Aramco is also looking to raise money on the international bond market, Saudi officials and executives said, a move that could open its accounts up to scrutiny from investors.

The transaction would supply the Public Investment Fund with much-needed cash, an unusual funding strategy that highlights Saudi Arabia's tight financial position. Even though oil prices recently have risen, the government is running a budget deficit this year after announcing the biggest fiscal stimulus package in the country's history.

Saudi Arabia turned to the international debt markets for the first time two years ago and has since raised at least $40 billion in sovereign debt to fuel spending. It is expected to raise more debt this year, increasing its ratio of debt to gross domestic product to 19%. Saudi Arabia has set itself a limit of 30% to clear its fiscal deficit by 2023.

Aramco has only a small amount of debt compared with other global oil giants, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, making it easy for the Saudi firm to borrow cheaply, people familiar with its balance sheet said. Aramco doesn't disclose financial results and the people with knowledge of its debt levels declined to comment on specifics due to nondisclosure agreements.

Neither Aramco nor Sabic are enthusiastic about the deal, said the officials and executives, but the companies have acquiesced under pressure from the prince's advisers. Aramco and Sabic have confirmed they are in preliminary talks, with Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser telling state television that he believed the deal would increase revenues.

Saudi Aramco Chairman Khalid al-Falih has long been opposed to a deal for Sabic, Saudi officials said. Sabic executives worry that the company would lose its identity in any deal, a person familiar with their thinking said.

A spokesman for PIF declined to comment on the potential deal. Spokespeople for Aramco and Sabic didn't respond to requests for comment.

Prince Mohammed's advisers see a deal between the kingdom's two largest companies as central to remaking the economy now that the IPO of Aramco is on hold, said the officials and executives.

The Public investment Fund need cash to fund ambitious plans, including building several cities and investing in non-oil sectors like mining and tech.

The Saudi fund is the biggest investor in SoftBank Group's $100 billion Vision Fund, making the kingdom one of the world's biggest technology-company investors. The fund is also expected to take on an important role in attracting foreign investment.

""PIF needs the money,"" said a Riyadh-based banker close to the companies involved. ""Because they have all the things they are developing right now.""

Raising debt from international banks instead of equity from foreign investors adds greater risk to Saudi Arabia's strategy to use the PIF to diversify the economy, said Ali Shihabi, the founder of Washington-based think tank Arabia Foundation.

""Aramco is going to have to borrow this money to fund PIF,"" said Mr. Shihabi, who previously worked in Riyadh as a banker. ""I don't see the logic behind it.""

The Public investment Fund in October said it managed $225 billion of assets, but it isn't clear how much of that wealth can be easily deployed.

PIF also is in discussions with international banks about a loan worth billions of dollars in a process that is separate from the talks about Aramco buying PIF's Sabic stake, said bankers involved in the process.

A deal for a stake in Sabic would also allow Aramco to expand its petrochemical operations. The Saudi government also has earmarked Aramco's shift from a supplier of crude oil to an integrated energy firm as a key pillar of the country's diversification away from oil.

""For the first time, Saudi Arabia is really taking diversification seriously,"" said Jim Krane, an expert on Saudi energy and a fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute.

Aramco and Sabic already have begun cooperating on projects. Last year, they signed an agreement to build a $20 billion chemicals complex.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-may-succeed-in-pushing-down-oil-and-gas-prices-after-all-2018-07-16,"President Trump has said gasoline prices are too high. He asked Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output by two million barrels. People who understand the industry immediately said there was no way the Saudis would raise its output because that would lower prices and profits.

Now the news is that Saudi Arabia is offering extra oil to some Asian customers. You don’t have to be a genius to infer that Saudi Arabia is indirectly complying with Trump’s request. In addition, with some help from Russia, Trump may succeed at lowering gasoline prices. Let’s examine the issue with a chart.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-tumble-230-points-after-us-unveils-new-china-tariffs-2018-07-11,"U.S. stocks snapped a four-session winning streak Wednesday after the Trump administration announced new tariffs on Chinese goods, further escalating tensions between the two largest economies in the world, which some investors fear could morph into a full-on trade war.

How did the market fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.02% slumped 219.21 points, or 0.9%, to 24,700.45.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% fell 19.82 points, or 0.7%, to 2,774.02. Only 1 of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in the green, with materials and the industrial sectors, both of which are seen as sensitive to trade issues, among the biggest losers. The energy sector also weighed on the market, tumbling more than 2% alongside a steep drop in the price of crude-oil futures. The utilities sector, up 0.9%, was the sole gainer.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% shed 42.59 points, or 0.6% to 7,716.61.

What is driving the market?

The White House late Tuesday said it would assess 10% tariffs on a further $200 billion in Chinese goods. The move is seen as deepening the rift with Beijing and sending a message to other trading partners that the U.S. is willing to escalate a trade fight. The U.S. last week hit Beijing with levies on $34 billion in goods, and Beijing retaliated with tariffs of the same amount. A final decision on the products to be hit with the new tariffs is expected after a consultation period in late August.

China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the new levies are “totally unacceptable” and that the behavior is hurting not just China but the whole world.

Recent gains in the market have come as Wall Street has attempted to pivot its focus to coming second-quarter earnings, which are expected to be strong. Such signs of economic strength, along with improving economic data, could provide a floor under equity prices, just as the trade issue serves as a ceiling.

What were analysts saying?

“This is different from the other trade announcements, because the size is significantly larger, and because China is unable to directly reciprocate at $200 billion because they don’t import that much. It’s unclear what it might do next, but it is clearly another step closer to a full-blown trade war,” said David Carter, who oversees about $2 billion as chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors.

“If the trade skirmish escalates into a full-blown trade war, that will be a bigger force in the markets than the strong fundamentals.”

“Even though the tariffs actually imposed up to now are relatively small in comparison to overall trade flows and GDP, it is hard to see how a full-blown trade war can be avoided at this stage. There is no-one left in the administration or in Congress to rein in President Donald Trump’s long-held protectionist beliefs and other countries are not shying away from the fight,” said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

What’s on the economic calendar?

The June producer-price index rose 0.3%, as did the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy. The 12-month rate of wholesale inflation, meanwhile, climbed to 3.4% from 3.1%, marking the highest perch since the waning months of 2011.

Separately, wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in May.

Among Federal Reserve speakers, New York Fed President John Williams was slated to deliver a speech on the economy to Brooklyn Town Hall at the Brooklyn Law School at 4:30 p.m. Eastern.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.46% is organizing itself into three different businesses as it continues to mull the future of its over-the-counter medicines unit. The stock fell 0.6%.

Shares of Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.82% dropped 2.3% after the tech company late Tuesday announced a partnership with German car maker Daimler AG DAI, -0.57% and auto-parts giant Bosch Ltd. to test robot taxis in California.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-slide-200-points-on-fears-of-a-full-scale-trade-war-2018-06-27,"A prior version of this report gave an incorrect factoid about the main benchmarks’ closing levels. It has been corrected.

Reuters

U.S. stocks closed solidly lower on Wednesday, with the losses driven by a pronounced drop in large-capitalization technology and internet stocks, while the S&P 500 closed below a closely watched technical level, which could be a sign that the recent weakness in stocks isn’t over yet.

Sentiment was once again driven by uncertainty over trade policy, and while major indexes opened higher, they turned negative in midday trading, with selling accelerating throughout the session and major indexes closing at their lowest levels of the month.

What did the benchmarks do?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.02% fell 165.52 points, or 0.7%, to 24,117.59. The blue-chip average closed below its 200-day moving average for a third straight session, a level that is often used a gauge of an asset’s long-term momentum.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.15% lost 23.43 points to 2,699.63, a decline of 0.9%. The benchmark index ended below its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 8.

While all 11 primary S&P 500 sectors had traded higher early in the session, buying enthusiasm waned in the afternoon, and only three of the 11 ended in positive territory. The information technology sector dropped 1.5% while consumer-discretional stocks ended down 1.3%, pressured by losses in both Amazon.com and Netflix Inc.

The financial sector fell 1.3% in its 13th straight daily decline, extending what had already been the longest losing streak in its history.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% sank 1.5%, or 116.54 points, to 7,445.08.

All three ended at their lowest levels of June. The Dow closed at its lowest since May 3, while the S&P ended at its lowest level since May 29 and the Nasdaq ended at its lowest since May 31.

What’s driving markets?

Trade-related headlines dominated global equities, and the whipsaw moves reflected uncertainty over the state of trade negotiations. President Donald Trump has indicated a commitment to protectionist policies, though he has decided to rely on existing laws, being updated by Congress, to restrict Chinese investment in the U.S.

What are strategists saying?

“Uncertainty around trade has risen with recent actions and rhetoric,” wrote Keith Parker, chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS, in a note to clients. “The unintended consequences of trade actions are having large impacts.”

He added that it was “more likely that the Trump administration would negotiate trade deals that benefit U.S. industry and not engage in a trade war, though the path remains bumpy/risky.” Any escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China could be “very disruptive.”

Dan Wantrobski, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, noted that major indexes remained in the same trading range they had been in for months, which he suggested was a sign that

“To a certain degree, investors are looking for something to be worried about. Stocks aren’t far from all-time highs, and for a lot of people that’s hard to justify,” he said. “However, I think volatility is returning to the U.S. market and that we could see another correction cycle. I’m not calling for a structural downturn, but tariffs and trade wars could exacerbate the weakness.”

Among the most actively traded technology names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.88% fell 1.6% while Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.04% was down 1.4%. Two consumer discretionary stocks also pressured the broader market: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.48% fell 1.8% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.35% lost 2.3%.

On the upside, energy stocks were solidly higher as crude-oil prices jumped 3.2% to their highest level since 2014. The rise came after a drop in crude stockpiles, a positive sign for supply.

Which economic reports are in focus?

Orders for durable goods fell 0.6% in May following a revised 1% decline in April, driven by a drop in new orders for trucks and cars.

The trade deficit in goods narrowed 3.7% to $64.8 billion in May, which was below the $69.2 billion estimate of economists polled by MarketWatch.

Separately, U.S. pending-home sales declined 0.5% to a reading of 105.9 in May.

Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said that economic policy makers on both the state and federal level should begin to take actions to limit the severity of the next economic downturn.

Indeed, we were warned over and over again that something wicked this way could come, as we as we slog our way through what has seasonally been the second-worst month of the year for the Dow. And while midterm elections have been one red flag, it seems trade stress is proving the big headache these days.

After Monday’s brutal action, many will be watching to see if investors can pick themselves back up today — it’s looking a little shaky so far — and if the Dow can pull back above its all-important 200-day moving average.

The 200day is important. What’s more important is how many sessions it stays below it! Or is it a fake out — Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) June 25, 2018

But fear not, because the veterans have been making the rounds, trying to calm everyone down. Like MarketWatch’s Mark Hulbert, who says that blue-chip breach makes for a fine time to pick up some stocks.

That leads us to our call of the day, from CrackedMarket’s Jani Ziedins, who tells us Monday’s takedown represents “the most attractive entry point in weeks” for the S&P 500. The index’s close at 2,717 puts it in the ballpark of an area that he says spells better bargains for investors.

“I don’t need to be the first to jump in at these levels and will let this play out a little bit longer, but today’s [Monday’s] discounts make this a far safer place to be buying than when we were at higher levels last week,” says Ziedins in a new blog post.

The fact that the S&P had a pretty rough day doesn’t really surprise the veteran investor, who has been watching closely as it neared big resistance around 2,800. The question now is whether Monday’s action was a “normal, routine and healthy dip” after a big run, or the start of a deeper rout, he says.

Ziedins gets the sense that there is plenty of fear that something much worse is to come, but urges investors not to buy into that.

“Just because [Monday’s] selloff looks and feels terrifying doesn’t mean it is real. Every buyable dip feels this way too,” he says.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-dismisses-climate-change-lawsuit-against-5-oil-giants-2018-06-25,"A federal judge on Monday dismissed lawsuits by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland alleging that five of the world’s largest oil companies should pay to protect the cities’ residents from the impacts of climate change.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted a motion by the companies — BP PLC BP, +0.18% , Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.A, +0.15% , Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.18% , ConocoPhillips COP, +1.10% and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.32% — to dismiss the suits, ruling that while global warming was a real threat, it must be fixed “by our political branches.”

“The benefits of fossil fuels are worldwide,” he wrote. “The problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case.”

The ruling is a blow to an emerging legal campaign by cities and municipalities, who are trying to argue that oil and gas companies created a public nuisance by producing fossil fuels they knew would result in harmful emissions. New York City and several other local governments in California, Washington and Colorado have also sued on similar grounds.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-set-to-rally-after-8-session-skid-blamed-on-trade-fears-2018-06-22,"U.S. stock benchmarks ended mostly higher on Friday as an OPEC-inspired rally in energy shares helped the Dow industrials halt a lengthy slide, but equities rang up weekly losses in a period pockmarked by a series of trade-related spats.

What did the main benchmarks do?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.02% rose 119.19 points, or 0.5%, to 24,580.89, with the equity gauge ending an eight-day losing streak, that if extended to a ninth session would have represented the longest losing since 1978.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.15% added 0.2%, or 5.12 points, to close at 2,754,88. Eight of 11 sectors finished higher, led by a 2.2% rise in the energy sector, a move that tracked a sharp rally in crude-oil prices.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% closed down 20.13, or 0.3%, at 7,692.82.

All three benchmarks finished off their best levels of the day in the final minutes of trade. Friday’s trading also marked the annual reconstitution of the Russell Indexes, where the index provider makes rule-based changes to composition of its indexes.

For the week, the Dow closed off 2%, marking its largest weekly decline since March 23, and its second straight weekly fall. The S&P 500 lost 0.9% over that frame and the Nasdaq booked a weekly drop of 0.3%, ending its streak of weekly gains at four straight.

What drove markets?

Investors have worried that trade tensions between the U.S. and major trading partners such as China and the European Union could develop into a big drag on the global economy. These concerns come as the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, is increasingly viewed as in the late stages of its expansion. The EU has said it would begin implementing tariffs on $3.2 billion in U.S. imports on Friday.

In the latest trade development, Trump threatened 20% tariffs on European cars coming into the U.S. General Motors Co. GM, -0.50% fell 0.3% while Ford Motor Co. F, -0.45% was down 0.5%. Tesla Inc. TSA, +2.09% sank 3.8%.

What did strategists say?

“We’re seeing continued uncertainty around trade, but there’s also a recognition that economic fundamentals remain strong, which could provide the kind of sturdy backdrop needed to support risk assets going forward,” said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments.

“The fact that recent declines have essentially been mild may be a sign that investors don’t believe we’re headed for a full-out trade war. Rhetoric could still escalate, having a meaningful impact on businesses and consumers, but we’re not there yet. We’re still in a wait-and-see mode,” she said. “There will be further negotiations, and we’ll likely continue seeing choppiness as this gets hammered out.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-conservative-pac-to-push-for-carbon-tax-in-us-2018-06-19,"A group of veteran conservative political leaders are launching a political-action committee to push for a U.S. carbon tax, a move potentially funded by several large corporations that could test Republican appetite to act on climate legislation.

The effort would put financial, advertising and lobbying muscle behind a policy proposed last year that called for taxing carbon emissions and returning the revenue as a dividend to Americans. Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, who both chaired the Federal Reserve, are among a number of individual and corporate supporters of the plan.

The new group, called Americans for Carbon Dividends and co-chaired by former U.S. senators Trent Lott and John Breaux, hopes to build momentum for legislation that Congress could pass after the 2020 presidential race.

Exelon Corp. EXC, +0.71% , a utility, plans to provide $1 million in funding for the campaign. A number of major corporations that have already come out in support of the policy are weighing financial commitments to the political group, including Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.18% and Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.A, +0.15% , according to people familiar with ongoing funding talks. The proposed legislation would protect fossil fuel companies from future climate-related lawsuits.

How are markets performing?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.02% fell 84.83 points, or 0.3%, to 25,090.48, having dropped 280 points at session lows. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.15% lost 3.07 points to 2,779.42, a decline of 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% shed 14.66 points to 7,746.38, a decline of 0.2%.

For the week, the Dow fell 0.9% while the Nasdaq rose 1.3%. The S&P 500 just barely ended in positive territory, up 0.01%, although that was enough to give the benchmark index, along with the Nasdaq, its fourth straight weekly advance.

The day’s trading was split evenly between positive and negative sectors. By far the biggest declining group was energy, which sank 2.1% on concerns about oversupply. Other “cyclical” sectors, or groups tied to the pace of economic growth, also fell on the day. Material stocks fell 0.6% while industrials were off 0.3%. Technology shares lost 0.5%.

The positive industry groups were filled with defensive sectors, which are seen as safer in periods of economic uncertainty, as the growth they offer tends to be lower than the overall economy, but more stable. Consumer staples rose 1.3% while the telecom sector was up 1.2%. Utilities rose 0.7%.

What drove the markets?

President Donald Trump approved tariffs on about $50 billion of Chinese goods, marking the latest escalation in the trade spat between the two countries. Beijing has said it intends to assess tariffs on a corresponding amount of U.S. goods, while Trump said the U.S. would pursue more tariffs if China retaliates. Subsequently, Trump said there was no trade war with China.

Trade tensions have been a major driver of market action over the past several months, though there has been more rhetoric than concrete moves thus far, and the issue hasn’t been enough to derail the general uptrend. All three indexes are solidly higher for June thus far—with gains ranging between 2.3% to nearly 4%—and both the Dow and S&P 500 a few percentage points away from joining the Nasdaq at record levels.

Read: Stock-market investors see China tariffs as a ‘buzzkill’

Separately, U.S. traders largely ignored the latest policy meeting by the Bank of Japan. The central bank stuck to its easing policy, keeping short-term interest rate at minus 0.1% and its target for the yield on 10-year government bonds at around 0%. The decision comes just a day after the European Central Bank said it plans to ends its quantitative easing program in December, but will keep rates at record lows at least until next summer.

What are strategists saying?

“People are worried that the trade issue could turn into something much more serious. It’s obviously never good to think you could be entering a trade war with another major economy, and it brings a lot of uncertainty to the equation,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth.

“That being said, people are still hopeful that this is a lot of chest pounding and negotiation tactics, as opposed to something more lasting. The market could be in a position to give something back if this persists, but unless things really escalate, I don’t think that will last.”

What’s on the economic calendar?

The Empire State manufacturing survey rose 4.9 points in June to a reading of 25, the highest reading since October. Separately, manufacturing production declined 0.7% in May, while capacity utilization dropped to 77.9% from 78.1% in the previous month.

The pre-salt reserves were discovered in 2006, but private companies were kept away and production delayed by rules that required state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, to be the operating partner with at least a 30% stake in any consortium in the region.

The government eased those rules last year to allow other companies to work without Petrobras if the state giant declined to participate in a project, although Petrobras still has the option to be the operator in areas it chooses.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-year-after-trump-announcement-on-paris-accord-and-climate-activists-are-busy-2018-06-01,"Friday marked the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s announcement that he was pulling the U.S. out of the global Paris Agreement, and environmental groups are clamoring for others to step up and plug the gap.

A coalition formed shortly after Trump’s announcement to encourage as many participants as possible from the private and public sectors to commit to a “We Are Still In” pledge now has more than 2,750 signatories, according to the sustainability-focused nonprofit Ceres.

The pledge is to stick with the primary goal of limiting the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees annually by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. That goal is crucial as insurers have warned that anything higher would make the world uninsurable. Signatories come from all 50 states of the U.S. and include business leaders, university presidents, faith and tribal leaders, and cultural institutions, representing 127 million Americans and $6.2 trillion of economic power.

“The number of private-sector leaders who have stepped into the breach is impressive, substantial and promising, and what states and cities are doing will go a long way toward meeting the goals,” said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres. “That said, the U.S. not being part of a global treaty that is absolutely essential to get to a below-2-degree world is beyond unfortunate.

“As much as voluntary commitments are great and extremely compelling, the fact is we need not just thousands but many more moving all at once to get where we need to go.”

The good news is the participation of major banks and investors, who have been leaders in committing to such actions as clean-energy investments and to divesting fossil-fuel-related securities. In the last few years, banks have committed $850 billion to clean-energy investments, said Lubber, while investors including public pension funds have placed billions more in low-carbon funds.

New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, for example, said in January he was doubling to $4 billion the allocation of the state’s Common Retirement Fund to its low-emissions-equities index. The fund, which provides benefits for the state’s police and firefighters, was the first public pension fund in the U.S. to create such an index, which excludes or reduces holdings in the worst carbon emitters and favors low emitters. The move raised the current value of the fund’s sustainable investments to more than $7 billion, said DiNapoli.

“Our investment decisions and our shareholder engagements are a caution to corporations: If they’re not helping build a decarbonized future, they may get left behind,” said DiNapoli.

That same month, the New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, as trustee of the city’s public pension funds, announced the goal of divesting from fossil-fuel reserve owners within five years. The move would mark the first such effort by a major U.S. public pension plan. The city has five pension funds, which hold about $5 billion in securities linked to more than 190 fossil-fuel companies.

The financial future of the city’s public-sector retirees is linked to the sustainability of the planet, said Stringer: “Our announcement sends a message to the world that a brighter economy rests on being green.”

At the same time, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio filed a lawsuit against the five biggest listed fossil-fuel companies predicated on their estimated contributions to global warming.

“The city will be seeking damages from BP BP, +0.18% , Chevron CVX, +0.32% , ConocoPhillips COP, +1.10% , Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.18% and Royal Dutch Shell RDSA, -0.84% for the billions of dollars the city will spend to protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change,” he said.

California’s pensions funds have been active, too. The $348 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System, known as Calpers, in April named its first investment managing director for its sustainable-investment program. Beth Richtman, who was an investment manager in the system’s real assets program, will manage the system’s environmental, social and governance integration.

Separately, Calstrs, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a $225 billion pension fund, named eight ESG-focused managers in April to receive investments when opportunities arise.

In the private sector, many companies have adopted climate goals, and some are now making climate-risk disclosures in their annual financial filings.

The industries that have lagged are in fossil fuels — not surprisingly — and the automobile sector, and the latter has been a big disappointment, said Lubber.

“The auto industry stood with us on Cafe [corporate average fuel economy] standards, they stood with us on emission limits. Now the Auto Alliance is standing with this administration rolling back those standards as we speak,” she said.

The Environmental Protection Agency under administrator Scott Pruitt on Thursday formally submitted a proposal to roll back the so-called Cafe rules, which were put in place under President Barack Obama as a way to limit tailpipe emissions, the New York Times reported. The rules required car makers to almost double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025 and were expected to make a significant contribution to greenhouse-gas reduction.

Automobile makers opposed the rules, which they said were too onerous. But they have been supportive of more stringent standards and are certainly worried about one possible unintended consequence of the rule change. California has vowed to maintain its own stricter rules on emissions using special status granted it under the 1970 Clean Air Act, a status the Trump administration said it would challenge.

But if California were to win a legal fight, it could create two sets of standards and effectively mean two separate car markets, one with the more stringent standards and one with the more lax ones.

“The Trump administration is rolling back a wide variety of regulations that protect our water, air, land and public health in order to benefit high-pollution industries that donate heavily to political campaigns,” said the nonpartisan and nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project.

The administration has targeted more than 60 environmental rules, many of them introduced by Obama.

“The world has got more complicated under this administration,” said Ceres’s Lubber.

Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is not expected to be much help to environmentalists under the current administration. There were hopes the SEC would introduce mandatory climate-risk disclosures in financial reporting, but those hopes have dimmed for now. Instead, some companies are making voluntary disclosures, typically in their annual regulatory filings.

“That’s great, but there are many more companies who are not making disclosures, and there’s no enforcement,” she said. “Yet the need to act is urgent — we need to move faster and at a far greater scale.”

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/atlantic-hurricane-season-rattles-nerves-in-the-commodities-markets-2018-06-01,"The Atlantic hurricane season has just begun, raising the potential for disruptions in a variety of commodities markets, from oil and natural gas to crops such as oranges and cotton.

Those markets already received a wake-up call from subtropical storm Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of the 2018 season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center first reported on the storm on May 25, and it was downgraded to a subtropical depression about three days later.

The season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, has “a major effect on many commodities directly, as well as indirectly via logistics and storage, and can mean excellent trading possibilities,” says Patrick Kerr, a senior broker at Halifax America.

Alberto’s early appearance managed to rattle nerves, with Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.32% Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.A, +0.15% and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.18% shutting production at some Gulf of Mexico oil and natural-gas platforms ahead of the storm, but oil US:CLN8 and natural-gas US:NGN18 prices traded lower despite the storm and associated shutdowns.

Cotton prices, meanwhile, jumped on concerns that the storm would flood drought-stricken crops in the southern Plains. On Friday, July cotton US:CTN8 marked a third straight weekly gain, settling at 93.30 cents a pound—the highest finish for a front-month contract in roughly four years. Futures prices have climbed nearly 19% year to date.

Offering a preview to possible scenarios in the new season, futures prices for orange juice, cotton, and lumber all rallied because of Hurricane Irma last year. The storm formed on Aug. 30 and made landfall in Florida in early September as a Category 4 hurricane. It was the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded.

Orange-juice futures US:OJN8 gained nearly 11% in September of last year because Florida accounts for about 60% of U.S. orange production. The state also produces many other commodities, including lumber. Combined with expectations for higher post-hurricane construction demand, lumber futures US:LBN8 climbed more than 4% in September 2017, and 14% the following month.

Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 helped lift U.S. retail gasoline prices in September to two-year highs, at the time, as the storm caused flooding, prompting shutdowns for several refineries. Over 45% of U.S. petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Hurricane weather can send gasoline prices “soaring as extreme weather can have adverse effects on everything from drilling operations and platforms, refineries to transport and storage,” says Kerr.

The oil and natural-gas markets can also be influenced by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which accounts for 17% of total U.S. crude-oil production. Federal offshore natural-gas production in the Gulf supplies 5% of the country’s total dry production, and the region is home to 51% of the nation’s natural-gas processing plant capacity.

Prices for oil and natural gas received some support from hurricane activity in the Gulf last year, but rising U.S. shale production has helped to dull the impact from Atlantic hurricanes.

“Offshore drilling and production is not what it used to be with the onset of shale output,” says Beth Sewell, managing partner at Quantum Gas & Power Services. Onshore wells are “really inexpensive to drill as compared to offshore wells so most producers opt to spend their money on onshore drilling.”

“The U.S. is not particularly reliant on offshore production like we were 10 years ago,” Sewell says. In addition, “technology is far superior…and platforms can be shut in as a storm approaches and brought back online fairly rapidly after it passes, so disruption likely is short term.”

She points out, however, that a storm striking the eastern seaboard can hurt demand for electricity, which in turn reduces the generation demand for natural gas—leading to a fall in prices for the commodity.

On May 24, forecasters for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a “near- or above-normal” 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. There’s a 70% chance that the season will see 10 to 16 named storms, of which 1 to 4 could be major hurricanes, with winds of 111 miles per hour or higher. An average season produces 12 named storms, including six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

Forecast aside, “we don’t know when [a hurricane] will develop, where in the U.S. it will hit, [or its] strength when ashore and what crops will be hit,” says Ned Schmidt, publisher of the Agri-Food Value View newsletter.

And while Alberto had only a small effect on the commodities markets, “it did get people to start thinking about hurricanes. It is that time again,” he says.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-select-oil-stocks-find-companies-that-know-how-to-handle-money-2018-05-29,"Updated with Wednesday’s oil-price action.

As oil prices slumped to less than $30 a barrel in January 2016, many U.S. producers with heavy debt burdens suddenly found themselves in serious trouble.

The result: Earnings turned to losses, and stock prices cratered. And then came the cost cuts, as companies struggled to dig out from potentially crippling debt.

But now, a new set of data shows which U.S.-traded energy companies have deployed capital most efficiently. (Please see the table below.) The top companies include Valero Energy Corp. VLO, -0.57% Phillips 66 PSX, +0.16% and Marathon Petroleum Corp. MRO, +2.54% among refiners, and also Core Laboratories CLB, +0.41% and Oceaneering International OII, +0.60% among oil-services companies.

Some companies with high return on corporate capital (ROCC) have seen their share prices rise more than that of their rivals as well as the S&P 500 Index over the past five years. But the link sometimes isn’t so clear. (Again, see the table below.) ROCC, incidentally, means net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt.

Even as West Texas intermediate crude US:CLN8 (WTI) has more than doubled to about $67 a barrel since reaching a low two and a half years ago, conditions seem ripe for the more efficient oil players. Oil producers have learned their lesson and worked on cost controls. Credit Suisse analyst William Featherston said in a report this month that the average break-even price for the oil exploration and production companies he covers was $43 a barrel in the fourth quarter, below the $56 average in early 2015.

WTI was up more than 2% on Wednesday, breaking a five-session streak of declines.

Here’s a one-year chart showing the percentage increase in West Texas crude prices against the S&P Composite 1500 energy sector’s total return:

A review of the S&P 500 Index energy sector shed light on oil refiners — the best-performing industry group through the oil bust and (partial) recovery.

FactSet Stock investors are not yet believers in the oil-price recovery

We then revisited energy companies with low leverage (debt), which have for the most part fared well during the recovery.

Now that the Shareholder Forum has updated its annual return on corporate capital (ROCC) data, we can look at a large number of energy companies and compare performance within their reported industry groups.

Return on corporate capital

Each company’s ROCC is compared to its industry competitors, based on the company’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which also comes from Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports. You can access ROCC comparisons for U.S.-traded companies here.

ROCC is meant to help investors understand how well a company’s management has used the capital it has raised through selling shares or borrowing money to produce goods and services for a profit.

Investors can find recovery plays or potential bargain stocks that might be temporarily undervalued by the market, but concentrating on a company’s success in its core business relative to competitors is a better way to limit risk while improving long-term returns overall, says Gary Lutin of the Shareholder Forum.

A company’s ROCC is compared to the aggregated assets and income data for the entire SIC group (of companies publicly traded in the U.S., no matter their size), excluding for the subject company. This means that the industry ROCCs for two companies in the same group may be different.

ROCC is most meaningful within industries, because some industries require more investment capital than others.

One drawback to ROCC is that companies’ reported SIC codes may not always perfectly match their core businesses, especially if the companies are conglomerates. So screening stocks by ROCC has its drawbacks, as does any other initial screening method. But it can help you pare a list before doing your own research to consider how well a company is likely to compete over the next decade.

ROCC winners among energy companies

The S&P 1500 Composite Index is made up of the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.14% the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -0.25% and the S&P Small-Cap Index SML, -0.33% There are 89 companies in the S&P 1500 energy sector, and the Shareholder Forum was able to gather sufficient data to calculate five-year ROCC averages for 83 of them. Of that group, 39 have negative average ROCC over the past five years, leaving us with 44 companies with positive average ROCC.

Of the remaining 44 energy companies, 23 have five-year average ROCC higher than the average for their SIC group. Here are all 23, ranked within each group. The larger groups are listed first, and there are five SIC groups with only one company represented.

A measure of volatility — the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, -0.16% or VIX — fell 13% to 14.88, after spiking 29% on Tuesday.

What’s driving markets?

A Reuters report indicated that output cuts implemented by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and nonmembers led by Russia will remain in place, sending oil prices sharply higher. Prices had been pressured in recent sessions amid expectations that OPEC would decide to lift production to help offset output losses from Iran and Venezuela.

Global equities and other assets generally perceived as risky found their footing Wednesday, as traders focus on what Italy’s politicians might deliver next. Italy’s stocks and bonds, as well as the euro, are rose.

A coalition government led by antiestablishment parties might be in the cards again for Italy, after it was blocked earlier in the week.

What are strategists saying?

“The fact that the market is shrugging off Italy’s political drama suggests that maybe it was a crowded trade that was being unwound and not something more serious,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co.

Antonelli said that recent spikes in volatility should remind market participants that capital markets are very fragile.

“Anything coming from the left field can shatter markets nowadays, so we have to brace for a long summer grind,” Antonelli said.

Which stocks were in focus?

Shares in Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +0.30% rose 1.9% after the maker of software for customer relationship management posted quarterly results and an annual outlook that beat forecasts.

HP Inc.’s stock HPQ, +1.35% rallied 4% after the maker of computers and printers posted a revenue beat late Tuesday, but earnings just matched forecasts.

Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. DKS, -7.76% stock jumped 26% after the retailer reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations and raised its guidance.

DSW Inc. DSW, -0.58% shares dropped 5.6%, pulling back from the previous session’s 2-year closing high, after the discount shoe and accessories retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, while keeping its outlook unchanged.

Which economic reports are on tap?

The U.S. added 178,000 private-sector jobs in May, payrolls processor ADP said Wednesday. April’s figure, meanwhile, was reduced by 41,000 to 163,000.

Meanwhile, the first revision of gross domestic product data showed the U.S. economy grew a touch softer in the first quarter than originally reported, mainly because of a slower buildup in inventories. GDP was trimmed to an annual 2.2% pace from 2.3%.

The trade gap in goods—services are excluded—fell 0.6% to $68.2 billion from $68.6.

What’s drove the markets?

Crude-oil futures tumbled 4% following the reports that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers may lift production by as many as 1 million barrels a day. Crude prices are up more than 12% thus far this year, which has lifted the energy sector. The industry is up more than 9% since the start of April, supported in large part by the rally in commodity prices. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE, +0.24% fell 2.6% on Friday. For the week, the fund lost 4.5%.

Investors also kept an eye on geopolitical headlines. After President Donald Trump called off a June 12 summit with North Korea, a senior official from Pyongyang said its leader Kim Jong Un is still willing to meet. U.S. stocks briefly tumbled Thursday on news that Trump had pulled out of talks, but traders seemed to be finding some reassurance in North Korea’s measured response.

“We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” said Kim Kye Gwan, a senior North Korea foreign ministry official, in a statement published by the North’s official state media. She was the same official who had harsher words for the U.S. administration a week ago.

What are market analysts saying?

“If the Saudis do lift oil production, that could be the news of the day. It may result in a weak patch for the energy sector, but for the broader market that could be offset by a rise in sentiment if it results in gas prices falling going into the summer driving season,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.

“There’s still a lot of questions about geopolitical issues with North Korea. Recent developments have seemed positive, but there’s a big question of what the sentiment is going to look like during the long weekend,” he said. “The question for investors is whether they should wait until Tuesday to see what happened over the weekend and make decisions then.”

What’s on the economic docket?

Durable-goods orders fell 1.7% April, but the decline was almost entirely due to a decline in contracts for Boeing planes. Most businesses took in more orders and increased investment last month.

Separately, a read on consumer sentiment came in at 98 in May, down from April’s reading of 98.8.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said central bank independence doesn’t just mean having the ability to determine interest rates without political interference, but set regulations as well. The central-bank chairman remarks came during a celebration of the 350th anniversary of Sweden’s Riksbank.

Which stocks are in focus?

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-look-hemmed-in-as-north-korea-gloom-offsets-dovish-fed-2018-05-24,"U.S. stocks finished in the red Thursday as a sharp decline in energy-related shares pressured the broader market lower. On a brighter note, the three main equity benchmarks closed off the worst levels of the session after President Donald Trump canceled a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, citing “open hostility” from the country.

What did markets do?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% finished down 75.05 points, or 0.3%, at 24,811.75, but had been down by as many as 280.91 points, or 1.1%. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.15% and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.28% down 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively, contributed the most to the blue-chip gauge’s stumbles.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% fell 5.53 points, or 0.2% to 2,727.76, with seven of the 11 main sectors closing lower. Energy shares led losses, down 1.7%, with financials not far behind, down 0.7%. The technology-centric Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.34% finished little-changed, off 1.53 points, or less than 0.1%, at 7,424.43.

What’s driving the markets?

Geopolitical worries hovered over markets after Trump called off the summit that was set to take place June 12 in Singapore.

The cancellation followed a statement from Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s vice minister of foreign affairs, in which he said if the talks didn’t go ahead, the U.S. could instead face off with North Korea in a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.”

Earlier, futures were trading higher, boosted by the minutes from this month’s Federal Reserve meeting, released Wednesday afternoon. They got credit for lifting stocks late during that session, as the central bank indicated it won’t be too aggressive in increasing interest rates.

Read: Here’s how stock-market investors could be surprised by a peak in rates

What are strategists saying?

“The selloff after the cancellation of the North Korea meeting was muted, largely because it doesn’t change the second-quarter earnings or economic growth,” Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial.

“Geopolitical risks are never fun and markets tend to price in the bad news right away and the good news only gradually,” Cavanaugh said.

“Global financial markets have been in a fragile state following corrections driven by policy fears, growth concerns, and of late, currency turmoil,” said Steven Wieting, Citi Private Bank’s global chief investment strategist, in a note.

What was on the economic docket?

Initial jobless claims rose by 11,000 to 234,000 in the week ended May 19, the highest level in seven weeks, but the increase is probably tied to seasonal swings in education-related employment. The layoffs number was higher than expected.

Elsewhere, existing-home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual 5.46 million pace in April, below expectations.

Ahead of those reports, New York Fed President William Dudley called for a continued shift away from a scandal-plagued rate benchmark — the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Dudley is a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee

Today we're hosting Markets Forum 2018.

Meanwhile, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said during a CNBC interview Thursday that he expects three rate hikes in 2018, and three rate hikes in 2019. Harker said he would be open to a fourth increase this year if inflation starts to run hotter. Harker also said policy makers are approaching the so-called neutral rate, which neither lifts nor reduces economic growth.

The Fed member also was slated to take part in a panel discussion at a Dallas Fed conference on technology-enabled disruption on Thursday. Harker isn’t currently a voting member of the FOMC.

Which stocks are in focus?

Shares of Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc. LB, -2.62% slumped 3.4% after the company lowered its outlook late Wednesday.

Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, +0.87% shares fell by 1.1% after the food company, whose brands include Skippy, Spam and Natural Choice, reported fiscal second-quarter results that were a touch shy of forecasts.

Best Buy Co Inc. BBY, -0.45% reported earnings that came in above expectations, but shares sold off nevertheless, closing 6.7% lower.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/two-ways-to-play-oil-stocks-while-limiting-your-risk-2018-05-14,"The recovery of oil prices looks to be “for real” this time, springing from a combination of stronger demand by developed economies and expected disruptions in supply from exporters including Iran and Venezuela.

Two data approaches shed light on ways that long-term investors can jump on the trend while limiting their chances of being burned.

FactSet The S&P 500 energy sector hasn’t kept pace with the rally in oil prices.

Don’t miss: Oil prices have surged above $70 — here are four key reasons behind the rally

The first way is simple: Concentrate on oil refiners. We recently looked at the best-performing oil stocks of 2018 and saw that among S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% energy stocks, oil refiners were the most consistent performers through the oil bust and (partial) recovery cycle.

The second way is to consider oil companies that have the lowest leverage, or borrowings. We first took this approach during the doldrums of January 2016, when oil was nearing its bottom. At that time, we listed the 10 S&P 500 energy stocks with the lowest ratios of long-term debt to equity as of Sept. 30, 2015. The idea was that the companies with the lowest amount of long-term borrowings relative to equity would be better positioned than competitors, not only to survive but to be able to take advantage of market turmoil to scoop up assets or make acquisitions on the cheap.

We checked in with the group in early May 2017 and found that for the most part, the stocks were performing well.

Here’s another look at the original low-leverage list form Jan. 8, 2016, and how the companies have performed:

The original list included the “old” Baker Hughes, which was combined with General Electric Co.’s oil and gas unit to form the awkwardly named Baker Hughes, A GE Co. BHGE, +0.75% in July 2017. The combined company is majority-controlled by General Electric.

Looking ahead, the low-leverage idea may still be a good one because interest rates are rising. Companies with lower levels of debt will feel less pain from rising interest expenses. They will also be better positioned to take shareholder-friendly actions, including raising dividends and buying back shares. Finally, lower leverage gives them more options if they are still looking to make (hopefully prudent) acquisitions.

So here are the 10 S&P 500 energy companies with the lowest ratios of long-term debt to equity, according to their latest filings:

You can click on the ticker for more about each company, including news, ratings, price ratios, estimates and financials.

It’s interesting to see that for Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.15% Helmerich & Payne Inc. HP, -0.12% Pioneer Natural Resources Co. PXD, -0.05% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.28% and Valero Energy Co. VLO, -0.61% the levels of long-term debt to equity are even lower than they were when we first looked at these numbers in January 2016.

Baker Hughes,a GE Co. just missed making the new list with a ratio of long-term debt to equity of 29%.",2018-05-14,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/15-dividend-stocks-whose-4-plus-yields-beat-treasury-bonds-2018-05-16,"Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes are now yielding more than 3%, which makes them more attractive for income-seeking investors than they have been for many years.

If you want to shoot for higher yields with dividend stocks, we have applied some stringent criteria to narrow a list.

Something to consider is that while 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.12% recently yielded 3.07%, the yield on two-year Treasury paper TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.46% was 2.58%. That is a very narrow spread, considering how much more of a commitment you make if you’re in for 10 years.

Don’t miss: You shouldn’t fear bonds just because yields are rising

If you are considering common stock for higher dividend yields, you need to do your own research to form an opinion about how “safe” the company’s regular dividend payments are. What is the chance that the company may cut the dividend? A publicly traded company is likely to be cautious when raising its payout because of the terrible fallout for the stock price if they are forced to lower the dividend.

Two dividend screens

With the 10-year yield climbing above the 3% threshold for the first time since 2011, we looked at S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% stocks with dividend yields of 4% or higher. This left us with a list of 43 companies.

We then compared the companies’ free cash flow yields with their current dividend yields. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. It measures how much money the company has available to pay dividends, buy back shares, expand organically, make acquisitions or for any other corporate purpose.

For real estate investment trusts, we used funds from operations (FFO) instead of free cash flow. FFO adds depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracts gains on the sale of assets. It is a non-GAAP figure that is considered to be a good measure of how much cash a REIT has available to pay dividends.

Don’t miss: Worried about expensive stocks? Chip companies are dirt cheap

We calculated free cash flow yields by dividing free cash flow per share over the past 12 months by the closing share prices. If a company’s free cash flow yield is higher than the dividend yield, the company appears to have ""headroom” to pay a higher dividend or at least maintain the dividend. This screen cut the list to 25 companies.

The next step was to look back 45 quarters to the beginning of 2007, to see if any of these companies had cut their regular dividends. That may seem a bit harsh, but it takes us back to before the financial crisis, which led to a tremendous number of dividend cuts. It’s still much less stringent than the 25-year look-back criteria for the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index SPDAUDP, -0.05% The Dividend Aristocrats are S&P 500 companies that have raised dividends each year for at least 25 years.

But the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL, +0.03% which tracks the Dividend Aristocrats index, has a dividend yield of only 2.51% according to Morningstar, so it really is more of a conservative growth play. (Disclosure: I hold shares of NOBL.)

Our dividend-cut screen reduced the list to 15 S&P 500 companies with dividend yields of 4% or higher that have not cut regular payouts since the beginning of 2007. Some may have started paying dividends more recently, but none have cut them, according to data provided by FactSet.

Here they are, sorted by yield.

As you can see from the year-to-date total-return figures, most of these stocks have not done well in the short term, as interest rates have risen. REIT stocks typically dip over the short term as interest rates climb. But interest rates don’t tell the entire story. L Brands has been the worst performer this year among the group, as its profits have suffered.

But all these companies have a history of maintaining or raising their dividend payouts. If you want to consider common shares of large companies for income, your next step is to do your own research to form an opinion about how competitive a company is likely to be in providing goods or services over the next decade. A short-term dip in the share price can be a buying opportunity.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-under-the-radar-market-sector-can-shift-your-stock-portfolio-into-overdrive-2018-05-17,"When most investors think about dynamic sectors, technology springs to mind first. After all, what’s more impressive than a small-cap cybersecurity stock or cloud-computing startup that doubles your money in short order?

But lately technology hasn’t quite been able to keep up with a select group of rather old-school stocks. Select materials companies, including oil and gas firms as well as metal and chemical companies, have been booming — and outperforming even big-name picks like Apple AAPL, +0.35% and Alphabet GOOGL, +1.06% GOOG, +0.93% in 2018.

Sure, some stocks have been under pressure — like Freeport-McMoRan FCX, +0.20% , which has tumbled 12% in the last month after reporting poor earnings, or Arconic ARNC, +0.39% , which imploded on fears of a trade war and is currently down over 30% so far this year.

When you look past the laggards, many materials stocks are outperforming the broader market. There are a number of reasons for this trend, including:

• An uptick in inflation, with raw material pricing hitting its highest levels since 2011.

• Tax cuts in the U.S. and a stronger global economy has led to robust growth and higher demand for raw materials. Specifically, the 2018 World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund forecast 3.9% growth globally in both 2018 and 2019. Plus, the World Bank forecast a 20% increase in energy commodity prices vs. previous expectations of a 16% increase.

Here are five companies profiting in the “materials world” of 2018.

Hess

With year-to-date returns topping 30%, oil exploration and production company Hess Corp. HES, +1.98% is firing on all cylinders.

Hess is a leaner and more focused oil company that is largely dependent on pumping oil out of the ground. That business hasn’t been without its challenges in recent years, with Hess stock regularly in the red due to low energy prices. But Hess shares have surged more than 60% from its lowest levels in more than a decade last summer, and momentum has kept going ever since.

The reasons for that is partially because of oil’s rebound and the narrowing of Hess’s losses as a result. But it’s also because of specific operations in the Bakken shale area of North Dakota that represents a big chunk of its current production, and could see as much as a 50% increase in output after big investment in the region. That’s in addition to going in with Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.15% on a massive project off the coast of Guyana that continues to uncover new oilfields for the pair to access.

Hess isn’t without its risks as it burns cash, but favorable energy pricing and more rigs adds up to a strong outlook for this oil stock.

SRC Energy

Oil is a big deal right now as crude prices remain high, but natural gas also has a lot to offer. After a brief dip in December, nat gas prices have stabilized — and SRC Energy SRCI, +1.86% is a great way to cash in on this trend.

Operating mainly in Colorado’s fruitful DJ Basin, SRC Energy underwent some big management changes in 2015 and quickly made a series of big acquisitions — including purchasing assets in the DJ Basin from Noble Energy NBL, +0.15% late last year that increased its drilling locations by more than 50%.

The proof of this increased output is in SRC Energy’s revenue growth projection of more than 70% for fiscal 2018, followed by nearly 30% on top of that in fiscal 2019. Earnings per share could also jump almost 70% this year and another 15% next year.

No wonder shares are up roughly 40% year-to-date as the benefit from that acquisition seems to be hitting the bottom line. And with the prospect of increased natural gas demand thanks to a potentially hot summer just around the corner, things could get even better for this stock.

Southern Copper

If you want to look at an impressive stock chart, dial up Southern Copper SCCO, +0.39% . Shares are more than 40% higher since their fall 2017 lows and up about 10% so far this year. The stock has recently been undergoing some consolidation, which means that now may be an excellent time to buy while the shares are at the lower end of their trading range.

The fact that this stock has climbed higher despite the threat of U.S. tariffs and even as copper prices moved lower in March is testament to its strength. In fact, a closer look at copper US:HGN8 over the past few months shows a series of higher lows and higher highs — a bullish outlook for the metal.

That’s because copper is the lifeblood of many industries, from wires and pipes to motors and roofing materials. When the global economy is looking up, so is demand for the “red metal.” At the same time, disruptions at major competitors BHP Billiton BHP, +0.65% and Freeport-McMoRan reduced supply in 2017.

That dynamic adds up to a big win for Southern Copper. And with a nice dividend of about 2.3%, this definitely seems like a materials stock worth a look in 2018.

Gerdau

While talk of a trade war and inflation helped remind investors about old industrial names in the U.S., Brazilian steel and iron miner Gerdau GGB, +0.26% is worth a look if for no other reason than its performance; the stock is up almost 50% in the past year, and roughly 30% since Jan. 1.

Once again, modest inflation and a robust global economy is creating tailwinds. Moreover, Brazil’s economy is showing promise after a rather ugly few years marked by the worst recession in the nation’s history and widespread political corruption.

Brazil returned to growth in late 2017, and at the beginning of the year the nation’s finance minister said the economy may be able to double the IMF’s forecast of 1.5% growth in 2018 and post something north of 3% — perhaps topping the U.S. and other more developed nations.

Steel prices have risen steadily since 2016 lows, in part because the industry has pulled back on supply. Increased demand at home and abroad will likely support Gerdau shares, and domestic strength will offset any fallout from the U.S.-China trade battles.

Mosaic

When most investors consider the materials sector, they focus on energy and metals. But agricultural chemicals and fertilizers, including potash and phosphate, are a big business in 2018.

Stabilization in the fertilizer industry has resulted in better pricing and nearly constant increase in Mosaic’s MOS, +2.11% stock price since September. Shares are up about 8% year-to-date and are nearing a new 52-week high — up about 35% from their September lows.

Analysts aren’t expecting momentum to slow. Stifel Nicolaus has increased its price target on Mosaic to $32 from $28. HSBC put an even higher $35 target on the stock thanks to supply-demand dynamics, and RBC Capital just upgraded the stock to “outperform” after sales topped expectations in its early May earnings report.",2018-05-17,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-oil-surges-to-72-a-popular-energy-fund-is-set-for-its-longest-win-streak-in-12-years-2018-05-17,"The U.S. oil benchmark hit a 3 ½-year high around $72 Thursday, helping to put a popular fund that tracks oil-related companies on pace for its longest period of uninterrupted gains ever.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE, +0.24% rose 1.5% on Thursday, notching its 10th straight gain—its longest winning streak since an equal stretch ended July 5, 2006. Moreover, if it books one more positive session, it would mark the best winning run for the XLE on record, according to data from FactSet and WSJ Market Data Group.

Read: Here’s why U.S. oil is trading at its biggest discount to the global crude benchmark since 2015

The run-up for XLE, which tracks some of the biggest oil production companies and refiners, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp. APC, +1.05% Valero Energy Corp. VLO, -0.61% Hess Corp. HES, +1.98% ConocoPhillips COP, +1.08% and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.15% has rallied 8.9%, so far this year. That compares with a slight decline of 0.02% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% a rise of 1.7% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% and an advance of 6.9% for the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.35%

The rally comes as West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange US:CLM8 trades at levels last seen in 2014, flirting with a fresh round-number level at $72 a barrel. Meanwhile, Brent oil UK:LCON8 the international benchmark, shot past another psychological level to briefly trade above $80 a barrel. Both WTI and Brent oil are on pace to post a nearly 20% year-to-date rise and are hovering around 3½-year highs.

The recent gains were underpinned by the U.S. decision to impose fresh sanctions on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and one of the world’s largest exporters. That added to an uptrend that began in late 2017 as efforts by OPEC and other major producers to curb output was seen helping to work off a global crude glut that had weighed on oil since a mid-2014 collapse in prices.

Most of the XLE’s components are enjoying triple-digit, year-to-date gains, however, returns for the fund are being held in check by lagging performance in one of its biggest components Exxon, down 2.1% so far in 2018, with the energy giant accounting for 23.25% of the XLE’s value.

XLE has the potential to mark its best quarterly return, up nearly 17% so far during the second quarter, since the fourth quarter of 2011, according WSJ Market Group Data.

Rex Tillerson was speaking to graduates of the Virginia Military Institute on Wednesday when he let that zinger fly.

With that kind of talk, no wonder the former secretary of state is out of a job. He may not have called out the Trump administration directly, but did he really need to?

The reaction across social media: Too late, Rex.

Tillerson, who left his job last year as the boss of Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.15% to work for Team Trump, hasn’t exactly kept his distaste for his government gig hidden after the president fired him in a tweet earlier this year.

He earned a warm reception at the State Department back in March following his departure for his description of Washington culture.

“This can be a very mean-spirited town. But you don’t have to choose to participate in that,” he said. “Each of us gets to choose the person we want to be, the way we want to be treated, and the way we want to treat others.”",2018-05-16,

Need to know: Relax. The stock market won’t crash this year—it can’t?!?—and here’s why

What are markets doing?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% closed up 68.24 points, or 0.3%, to 24,899.41, marking its eighth straight advance and the longest positive streak since one that ended Sept. 20.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% added 2.41 points, or 0.1%, to 2,730.13, with gains in energy, up 0.6%, and health care, advancing 0.7%, more than offsetting declines in real estate, industrials and telecommunications, which were off at least 0.4%.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.35% climbed by 8.43 points, or 0.1%, at 7,411.32.

All three benchmarks finished off their best levels of the day.

Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.17% of small-capitalization shares, which has been outperforming over the past three months, finished lower after coming within striking distance of an intraday record at 1,615.52 set on Jan. 24, and closed down 0.4% at 1,600.34.

Last week, the Dow rose 2.3%, the S&P 500 advanced 2.4%, and the Nasdaq climbed 2.7%.

What is driving the markets?

Stocks have been buoyant on the back of the perception that the Wall Street may be turning a corner on concerns that have been holding investors back, including trade issues with China.

Some fresh optimism was injected in to the market ahead of the trade talks tentatively scheduled for this week between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to keep struggling Chinese telecom giant ZTE ZTCOY, +4.90% 0763, +4.52% in business.

ZTE was hit by sanctions roughly a month ago. The measures ban U.S. companies from selling to it, but Trump tweeted that he has asked for a stay of that order, as ZTE said its survival is being threatened.

Optimism over corporate earnings also has helped to keep the markets afloat, though the 10-year Treasury benchmark yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.12% flirting with a level at around 3%, tested investors’ comfort levels, keeping the market’s advance in check. Rising yields tend to mean higher costs for major corporations and can peel money away from stocks. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar saw muted trade, with its recent rally, begun in April, moderating over the past four sessions. A stronger currency can be a headwind for companies with overseas businesses, making their products more costly.

Economic preview: Inflation pause lends helping hand to borrowers

What are strategists saying?

“We’re getting a bump higher on this trade news, since it seems like Trump is backing off his rhetoric with China. He came out very aggressively, but now he’s walking that back, which is encouraging,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management.

“Now, I don’t think the concerns are fully out of the market. We’re still seeing higher interest rates and valuations are still at the high end of their historical range,” he said. “We’re a bit more overweight on bonds with a shorter-term duration than equities, though we still like tech, which continues to perform well and see strong earnings growth.”

What stocks are in focus?

Xerox Corp. XRX, +0.00% shares dropped 4.3% after the technology firm said it would abandon its merger deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. 4901, +0.21% as it reached a settlement with two of its biggest shareholders. Subsequently, analysts at J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to neutral, saying the terminated deal elevated near-term risks.

Shares of Symantec Corp. SYMC, +0.35% rose 9.6%. The gain after it plummeted 35% Friday on the back of the company’s audit committee announcing an internal investigation, which spurred a number of analyst downgrades. On Monday, the company said it had scheduled an “investor briefing call” and that it would “provide more information on the previously announced internal investigation.”

Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD, -2.45% rose 6.7% after the struggling retailer announced it would begin the formal process of exploring a sale of assets including the Kenmore brand.

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.02% fell 3%. Matthew Schwall, a senior executive who is the company’s main technical contact with U.S. safety regulators, has reportedly left for rival Waymo LLC. That comes after news Tesla’s top engineer overseeing auto development was taking a sabbatical.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.45% plans to assume majority ownership of its Chinese fund-management joint venture, its latest step toward establishing a firmer foothold in China after Beijing recently relaxed its rules for foreign ownership of financial firms. Shares of the bank ended flat.

Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc. HMNY, -7.69% the majority owner of MoviePass, rose 4.8% in early trading. The stocks plummeted nearly 70% last week.

The VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK, +0.17% rose 1.9% after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in a case that could open sports betting around the country.

Energy shares rose broadly, supported by a rise in the price of crude oil. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.15% rose 0.9% while Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, +2.54% was up 2.2%.

Among the technology stocks supporting the market, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.90% rose 0.3% and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.06% class A shares rose 0.3%.

Which Fed speakers are in the spotlight

Among Federal Reserve speakers in the spotlight Monday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester in a speech in Paris said the central bank may need to raise interest rates above 3%. She said the Fed may be looking at higher interest rates to achieve stable inflation and low unemployment goals.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that cryptocurrencies were taking the country back to the 1830s, citing the inefficiency of different currencies trading at different rates at different times.

What are other markets doing?

Asian markets were higher, with Malaysian stocks FBMKLCI, -0.34% volatile as markets opened for the first time since the surprise election win for Mahathir Mohamad’s opposition coalition.

European stocks SXXP, +0.09% ended mostly lower as traders tracked developments in Italian politics.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/even-small-investors-have-this-one-superpower-2018-05-14,"When you buy a company’s stock, or invest in a fund that includes lots of stocks, your top goal is probably to make money when the share price (hopefully) rises. But earning good returns isn’t the only perk of owning stocks.

When you become a shareholder, you become a part owner in the company in which you’re investing. That means you get a say in what that company is doing and can influence it to act in a way that meshes with your values, whether that’s profitability, sustainability or both.

How much of a say do I have?

Generally, one share equals one vote—meaning big, institutional investors with the most dollars invested have the most sway. But speaking up when it counts can mean a lot.

Can I really have an impact?

Activist investors have made an impact in plenty of cases. For example, at Exxon Mobil, XOM, +0.15% 62.3% of shareholders last May went against company management and voted to increase transparency about climate-change issues and how they affect the company. Of course, the big bosses don’t have to do what shareholders want, but they do want to keep the money happy—and that’s exactly what Exxon did. In February, the company released its 2018 Energy Outlook and Energy and Carbon Summary.

Keeping it real: Those investors included financial firms BlackRock, BLK, -0.50% Vanguard and State Street STT, -0.91% —i.e., folks with deeper pockets than you alone. But even relatively small-time investors have the right to submit a proposal seeking to change company policy.

Take Jing Zhao, a regular investor who owns just 12 shares of Tesla TSLA, -1.02% stock and recently submitted a detailed proposal to remove the board’s chairman, Elon Musk. He probably won’t get his way, but he did capture board members’ attention (and the media’s) and received an official response, showing that companies do listen, at least.

So how do I voice my own opinion?

The standard process is a little antiquated—for now. Any investor who owns $2,000 worth of stock, or at least 1% of shares, for a year or more through at least the next annual shareholders meeting is permitted to submit a proposal related to “ordinary business,” such as executive compensation, social policy or another reasonable subject.

The company can reject a proposal, of course. In one study, researchers found that about 40% of proposals were contested by management. The firm must file a letter with the Securities and Exchange Commission, stating why they intend to bar it from making it to a vote. You and the company can go back and forth, along with the SEC, for a while. (For a deeper look at all that red tape, you can check the SEC’s summary.)

Voting on a proposal is easier. You can do so in person at the annual shareholders meeting or via proxy. Proxy forms are sent to all shareholders, along with an invite to the big meeting. You know, they’re those cards you probably let collect dust before finally tossing them into the recycling bin.

But a new standard is working its way into the field and should help make it easier to exercise your voice and voting rights. A new platform called SAY (from Acorns’ co-founder, Jeff Cruttenden) is digitizing the shareholder voting process, making the whole thing more accessible for individual investors like us.

“We’re focused on the shareholders and giving them the information they need to understand their voting rights and also to provide access to those voting rights,” Cruttenden says. “We’re helping verified shareholders connect with one another and with the issues that they care about. We want to give investors their say.”

However you choose to wield that superpower, don’t throw away your chance.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-us-listed-chinese-stocks-that-could-unlock-outsize-gains-2018-05-10,"China’s economy has been on the minds of nearly every U.S. investor this year.

It’s not just policies out of Washington and the posturing that began in March that could lead to a trade war with Beijing. Nor is it more recent political developments from the Trump administration, including talks with North Korea and other Asian players.

It’s the fact that Chinese stocks continue to present tremendous profit potential — and with U.S. stock markets admittedly challenged since their early 2018 highs, it’s worth considering what this overseas growth engine has to offer.

Of course, many investors may not see a lot of fireworks in China because they are only watching a few big-name ETFs that are seen as broad plays on the nation. Consider the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, +0.07% with $4.5 billion in assets, which is up 2.7% this year through Wednesday compared with the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% that’s up just 0.9%. And the SPDR S&P China ETF GXC, -0.13% with over $1 billion assets but a slightly different portfolio mix, has gained 3.6%.

But as the old saying goes, it’s a market of stocks — not just a stock market. And just as a bias toward some of the biggest U.S. growth names over the last year would have delivered outsize returns, a focused on China’s highfliers can potentially unlock amazing outperformance.

Here are 10 names to consider: five big players plus five-lesser known picks that could offer rapid growth.

5 big-name China plays

Though still technically an emerging market, China has many mature large-caps that are as entrenched – and perhaps even in a better position – than some U.S. blue-chip stocks. And since they trade on U.S. exchanges, there’s really no reason every serious investor shouldn’t already be considering whether to invest in these names.

Baidu

Though shares in internet giant Baidu Inc. BIDU, -0.12% have been incredibly volatile since last fall, moving regularly between roughly $220 and $270 a share, a massive earnings beat in April has powered the stock once again to the top part of its range, and it seems poised to finally break out to new highs. That’s no surprise, given that huge beat on the profit side — and that the company plans to sell a stake in its financial-services business to both focus its operations and unlock a bunch of capital.

Shares are up 13% in a just a few weeks since that report, and rapidly approaching a new high.

Alibaba

Alibaba Group Holding BABA, -0.54% was the talk of the market in 2017, as the stock roughly doubled on the year thanks to strong growth metrics. Shares haven’t exactly broken out to a new high in recent months — they are struggling to break through $200 — but the e-commerce company’s growth is still going strong.

In fact, its May earnings report showed a nice beat for its fiscal fourth-quarter results, with adjusted net income up 37% and revenue up an impressive 61% year-over-year. Of particular note was the fact that its cloud computing business revenue doubled over the prior period. This may be just the news Alibaba needs to break out to a new 52-week high.

Sinopec

China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation SNP, +1.09% 0386, +0.25% 600028, +0.15% colloquially known as Sinopec, is one of the biggest energy companies on the planet. And with a share-price run of about 50% from its December lows, it is also one of the best-performing stocks in the space lately.

Sure, that’s in part because oil has firmed up and it’s up against easier comps, but compared with U.S. oil giants like Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.15% and Chevron CVX, +0.28% that have struggled mightily since their February highs, Sinopec looks incredibly attractive both because of its fundamentals and its momentum.

Weibo

Weibo Corp. WB, -0.20% a digital company spun out of media giant SINA Corp. SINA, -0.57% is often referred to as the “Twitter of China.” But that doesn’t do Weibo justice, since the company has always run a very profitable operation and is seeing sustained growth, whereas Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.24% has struggled with both of those items.

Last year, Weibo users surpassed Twitter’s audience. And consider that earnings per share for this fiscal year are expected to hit $2.80 for 55% year-over-year growth, and then surge to $4.00 according to FY2019 projections. If you ever believed in the hope and hype behind Twitter, look at Weibo — where the growth is actually real.

China Telecom

China Telecom Corp. CHA, +0.31% 0728, +0.00% isn’t quite as dynamic as some of the other large-caps on this list. However, with more than 250 million wireless subscribers in this increasingly connected region, it’s hard to ignore — particularly after fiscal 2017 results posted in March that featured stronger-than-expected profits.

Sure, the dividend is only paid once annually and the yield is just short of 3% at current pricing, while U.S. telecoms are roughly double that. But the stability and growth of this powerhouse can’t be ignored.

5 lesser-known China stocks

These five large-cap stocks aren’t the only high-potential investments in China, however. These five unsung stocks could be interesting to investors who either already own a stake in the aforementioned giants, or who simply want to be more aggressive and get in on the ground floor of tomorrow’s leaders.

Autohome

If you haven’t heard of online car portal Autohome Inc. ATHM, -0.34% you’re missing out on one of the biggest growth stories of the last year. Just as U.S. platform Carvana CVNA, +0.28% has exploded as it takes the car-shopping experience into a digital age, with its stock up over 100% in the last 12 months, so has this similar China company. Autohome shares are up nearly 170% in the last year, marching higher in a nearly straight line. The company beat profit expectations in its earnings report this week, and with the China market still robust even as the U.S. faces slowing auto sales, this is a stock to watch.

Melco

Casino operator Melco Resorts & Entertainment MLCO, -0.12% is a big player in the gambling destination of Macau. Gaming is a huge cultural force in China, and with consumer spending in the region on the rise, it’s no surprise that Melco continues to cash in. Shares are up more than 40% in the last 12 months, in part because of strong numbers in its earnings report last week that showed robust gross gaming revenue as well as another profit beat.

As Chinese consumers remain eager to open their wallets, Melco should continue to outperform.

58.com

58.com Inc. WUBA, +0.50% is an online classified-ads leader in China, often compared to domestic portal Craigslist. This is another name that was red hot in 2017 as it finally achieved consistent profitability; its stock more than doubled in that time. It remains red hot in 2018, thanks to continued success. Earnings per share not only remain positive, but analysts are expecting 35% profit growth this year and more than 40% growth next fiscal year. Shares are up 15% year to date as a result.

New Oriental

New Oriental Education & Technology Group EDU, +4.87% offers private educational services like test prep, online courses and even preschooling. The stock can be a bit volatile, but the long-term trend is definitely higher with almost 40% gains in the last 12 months. That’s in part because of a strong growth outlook, including its late-April earnings report that showed a 41% jump in revenue from a year ago and adjusted operating income growth of 23%. Consistent double-digit earnings growth shows the power of China’s emerging for-profit education sector as the nation continues to focus on initiatives to make its workers globally competitive in the 21st century.

Vipshop

Unlike some others on this list, Chinese e-commerce play Vipshop Holdings VIPS, +0.50% hasn’t reported its earnings yet. But when those numbers drop on Tuesday, you can expect some fireworks — particularly given the big full-year report in February that featured a 29% jump in annual revenue thanks to a 24% growth rate in total orders, reaching nearly 58 million customers.

This isn’t quite a business on the scale of Amazon.com AMZN, +1.47% but investors clearly like what they see given that the stock is up more than 35% year-to-date in 2018 and has roughly doubled from its lows late last year.

Oil is now trading at over $70 a barrel, pushing up shares of energy companies.

A look at total returns for shares of large oil companies highlights a pattern that may make it easier to make money in the sector.

Meanwhile, the possibility of new sanctions against Iran, President Trump’s potential decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Iran, and OPEC’s efforts to prop up prices by cutting production could mean additional gains ahead for U.S.-listed oil stocks.

Myra P. Saefong detailed four reasons for this oil rally.

Here’s more on how Iran could affect the oil market.

The energy sector of the S&P 500 was up only 3% through May 7 this year. There are 31 stocks in the sector. Here’s a list showing how well they have performed this year and in 2017, along with returns for longer periods:

You can click on the tickers for more information, including news, ratings, price ratios, estimates and financial results.

The pattern is clear: The oil refiners/marketers have been the most consistent performers across time periods. They rely less on the price of crude oil and have an easier time being consistently profitable because of their markups and profits from oil refining and the distribution of refined products, including gasoline.

The broader market had been enjoying a bump from energy-related companies, which rallied as crude-oil prices hit multiyear peaks.

How are the main benchmarks performing?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% finished 94.81 points, or 0.4%, higher at 24,357.32. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% added 9.21 points to 2,672.63, or 0.4%.

The Russel 2000 RUT, -0.17% the index of small capitalization stocks, meanwhile, closed 13.34 points, or 0.9%, higher at 1,578.95.

What’s driving markets?

Trump tweeted that he would make an announcement on a possible decertification of the Iran nuclear agreement that the Obama administration had reached with the Middle Eastern country back in 2015. European leaders had urged Trump not to abandon the pact.

I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018

Trump had until May 12 to decide whether to keep the deal intact. Abandoning it would trigger a reimposition of economic sanctions on Iran, hampering oil exports from the country and cutting global supply.

Meanwhile, U.S. oil benchmark US:CLM8 ended sharply higher on the day but came off those highs in electronic trading, retreating from its highest level since 2014.

Beyond oil, global trade headlines were also in focus, after a team of U.S. negotiators weren’t able to secure a trade agreement after multiday talks with counterparts in Beijing. China state media said talks were positive, and more negotiations would be needed to avoid a trade war, the South China Morning Post reported.

Also on the trade front, officials from Canada, Mexico and the U.S. met in Washington for another round of discussions regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement. Market participants expect the parties to reach a deal in principle this month.

Richmond Federal President Tom Barkin, meanwhile, kicked off the of the trio of Fed speakers scheduled for the afternoon, saying inflation was stable and there was no need for the Fed to step up its pace in the current economy environment.

In economic data, consumer credit rose 3.6% in March.

What are strategists saying?

“We’re waiting on more clarity about the Iran deal. If Trump pulls out, which other leaders have urged him not to do, then supply will be cut, which will have the same impact as rising demand in terms of driving up prices. But even beyond that, we’re entering the summer driving season and the energy sector has been down for so long that it looks poised for a rebound,” said Mark Martiak, senior wealth strategist at Premier Wealth/First Allied.

“Beyond that, there are no obvious catalysts on the horizon, which leaves more room for geopolitical risk to impact trading. I think valuations are fair, but I also expect we’ll see a lot more volatility going forward.”

Which stocks are in focus?

Energy stocks earlier rose broadly alongside the gain in oil, but pared gains following Trump’s tweet. Chevron Corp.’s CVX, +0.27% stock fell 0.5% after being up as much as 2.3% on the day, while Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.15% shares ended up 1.1%, but were up 2.8% at the peak. ConocoPhillips COP, +1.08% shares finished 0.1% lower.

First-quarter earnings season remains in focus, though the vast majority of S&P 500 companies have already posted their results.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/businesses-are-investing-more-but-its-not-because-of-the-tax-cut-2018-05-04,"This corrects an earlier version of this column, which erroneously referred to the “Bureau of Economic Affairs.” The acronym BEA stands for the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Business investments rose at a 6.1% annual rate in the first quarter, a solid rebound from the two-year slump that accompanied the collapse of oil prices.

Everyone is talking about jobs but I’d like to talk about another economic statistic that’s more important for the long run: Capital spending.

Yes, capex investment might seem like a boring topic compared to Stormy and Rudy and Kanye and even the labor-force participation rate, but I’d argue that the course our economy takes over the next decade depends to a large degree upon the decisions that business leaders are making right now about how much capital to deploy back into their business and how much to return to owners.

If we want more jobs, higher wages and a more productive economy later, we need to invest now in offices, factories, computers, machinery, trucks, software, research and development, and a thousand other essentials that make businesses run.

The good news is that corporations are increasing their investments again after a slump in 2015 and 2016. Over the past year, real business investment has increased at a 6.1% annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Department. It’s a good number, but nothing jaw-dropping.

The bad news is that net investment is very weak by historical standards. Companies have loads of cash, but little is going back into the business.

It used to be that nonfinancial corporations invested up to 40% of their cash flow back into the business. Now it’s half that.

This dismal trend may be about to change for a very good reason: Businesses are reporting that strong demand is running up against the economy’s capacity (including imports). Supply chains are tight, and prices are rising for goods and services in short supply. The natural response by profit-maximizing companies would be to expand their capacity rapidly to meet demand, and to some extent that seems to be happening.

According to an analysis by equity strategist Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, capital spending by large companies in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% is on pace to increase 20% year-on-year, based on the companies that have already reported their first-quarter earnings.

Two-thirds of the first quarter’s dollar increase in capex comes from just 10 companies.

But Golub cautions against seeing the pickup in capex as a broad trend. It’s concentrated in just a few sectors and in stocks “with higher [return on equity] opportunities,” he wrote in a note to clients. Two-thirds of the dollar increase in the first quarter comes from just 10 companies: Alphabet GOOG, +0.96% General Motors GM, -0.54% AT&T T, -0.40% Verizon VZ, +0.36% Walmart WMT, -0.32% Amazon AMZN, +1.47% Microsoft MSFT, +0.89% Intel INTC, -0.19% Micron MU, -1.57% and Charter Communications CHTR, +0.38%

There’s another reason, of course, why companies might be expected to increase capital spending: The $1 trillion corporate tax cut that took effect on Jan. 1. Getting companies to invest more was the stated objective of the Republican office holders who pushed it through. They said letting companies keep more of their profits would lead to a surge in capital spending that would, in turn, boost the productivity of the economy and make the economy grow at 3% (or more) again year after year.

Aside from anecdotes, there is little evidence so far that companies have been motivated by their tax savings to invest more. The hard data don’t show any sizable increase since Jan. 1 (insert the usual warning to never take one quarter’s gross domestic product as definitive proof of anything).

In the first quarter, the government estimated, real nonresidential investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property rose at a 6.1% annual rate, down from 6.8% in the fourth quarter and 7.1% in the first quarter of 2017.

Investments in structures rose at a 12.3% annual pace, the fastest in a year, but they fell if you exclude the big rebound in oil and gas drilling. Investments in equipment rose at a 4.8% annual rate, the slowest in a year. Investments in intellectual property increased at a 3.6% annual rate, about in line with the average for the past five years.

In a word: unremarkable. There was nothing in the GDP investment data that pointed to any significant surge due to the tax change. It was just business as usual, reacting to the opportunities in the market. In coming quarters, we’ll be watching the capex figures closely to see if the tax cut is helping.

But in the first quarter, there was little correlation between the companies that got the biggest tax breaks and the companies that are investing the most. Google got a huge tax break and boosted capex by a lot, but Apple AAPL, +0.35% got the biggest break of all and announced that it would return almost all of its windfall to shareholders. General Motors invested $6.7 billion in the first quarter (the second-most of any company), but actually lost money on the tax cuts.

Several companies announced capital-spending plans following the tax cut, but an analysis by the admittedly hostile Americans for Tax Fairness found that most of the “new” capex spending by companies such as Apple, Comcast CMCSA, +0.11% and ExxonMobil XOM, +0.15% wasn’t new at all, just a continuation of previous trends.

So far, American corporations seem to be doing just what most economists expected them to do: Return the bulk of their tax-cut windfall to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. It’s not a lack of capital that’s holding back investments in the American economy, it’s a lack of imagination.

So, the plan is to give the money to the people who already have more than they know what to do with. And even the most imaginative of our modern magnates can’t think of much to do with his fortune except build a rocket ship so he can escape.",2018-05-04,
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/exxon-or-chevron-this-analyst-says-theres-one-stock-to-pick-2018-04-30,"Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. both reported mixed first-quarter results, but for analysts at Barclays there’s one clear winner to pick between the two oil majors.

It all comes down to a “structural deterioration” in Exxon’s project portfolio, making Chevron’s stock a clear favorite, said the analysts, led by Paul Cheng.

Exxon XOM, +0.15% and Chevron CVX, +0.28% reported first-quarter earnings last week, with Exxon missing Wall Street per-share expectations while Chevron missed sales forecasts.

Exxon reported earnings of $1.09 a share, a penny lower than what Wall Street had called, on sales of $68.2 billion, compared with consensus sales expectations of $67.2 billion.

See also: Global oil supply surplus may soon become a shortage

Chevron reported adjusted earnings of $1.83 a share on sales of $37.8 billion, compared with expectations of earnings around $1.48 a share on sales of $40.9 billion

A closer look, however, revealed a less rosy picture at Exxon, the Barclays analysts said.

Core exploration and production earnings came in strong at Exxon at $3.5 billion, compared with consensus of around $3.2 billion, but results included a gain on asset sales of $366 million, they said. The adjusted upstream result would have been around $3.1 billion, which would have pushed the per-share earnings result under $1, they said.

“(Exxon’s) underlying upstream fundamentals appear to have suffered a structural deterioration, due in large part to two massive, ill-timed, low margin and extremely expensive investments,” namely the acquisition of natural-gas producer XTO Energy and its Kearl oil-sands project in Canada, they said.

“Essentially, 1Q18 results are implicitly revealing the issues (Exxon) is facing with the status quo of its upstream portfolio,” the analysts said.

Despite Exxon shares’ underperformance over the last 18 months, and particularly since February, they maintained the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock and said they continued to prefer Chevron as well as ConocoPhillips COP, +1.07% and Suncor Energy Inc. SU, +0.53% over Exxon.

Chevron’s first-quarter results “will have positive impact on its near-term share performance,” with results strong across the board and “in stark contrast to an uninspiring print by Exxon,” the Barclays analysts said.

The contrasting first-quarter results by the two U.S. major integrates are “a preview of the upstream struggles Exxon may face going forward,” they said.

“(Chevron’s) positive first-quarter result was an encouraging sign that Chevron is executing well and we remain constructive on the company’s long-term, shareholder-friendly plan,” the analysts said. They increased their price target on Chevron to $145, which would represent a 15% upside over Monday prices.

Exxon shares have lost 4.5% in the past 12 months, and Chevron shares have gained 18% in the same period. That compares with a 12% advance for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% and a 16% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, -0.03%",2018-04-30,Chevron
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-powerful-investment-lesson-you-can-learn-from-an-anniversary-you-probably-forgot-2018-05-01,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Today’s investment pop quiz: What happened eight years ago that nearly bankrupted one of the world’s largest companies?

The answer: BP’s BP, +0.12% BP., -0.77% disastrous Gulf oil spill, which began with an explosion on a BP-operated oil drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010. It took six months to contain the resultant spill, during which an estimated 210 million U.S. gallons of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico. It was the worst accidental marine oil spill in history.

At its low point during the summer of 2010, BP’s stock was 56% lower than where it stood on the day of the explosion. There was widespread speculation that BP wouldn’t be able to survive in its then-current form. It felt a like a death watch.

It turned out to be anything but, however. Since the date of BP’s summer 2010 low, its stock has been one of the best-performing of any of the major oil-and-gas companies’ shares. Its annualized total return since then has been 12.1%, according to FactSet, nearly doubling the 6.8% annualized return of the SPDR Energy Select ETF XLE, +0.23% BP beat ExxonMobil XOM, +0.15% by an even greater margin.

Moreover, BP’s stock performance since June 2010 has even come close to matching that of the S&P 500’s SPX, +0.14% 14.5% annualized return, despite the price of oil being more than 10% lower.

There’s a powerful investment lesson that can be learned from this history lesson: The time to buy is when the blood is running in the streets, to quote the Baron Rothschild, perhaps history’s most famous contrarian.

The reason this is good advice is not that companies on a death watch are suddenly about to become incredibly profitable. Instead, the contrarian rationale is that investors overreact in the face of bad news. This allows the stock plenty of room to rebound even when the company’s profit picture proves to be mediocre.

BP is a perfect example. Even though its earnings per share over the last 12 months are still way before their level in the year before the 2010 oil spill, the company’s stock has produced a 12.1% annualized return from its post-spill low.

By the way, don’t think it’s simply Monday-morning quarterbacking for me to point this out now, eight years after the disaster. One of the top-performing newsletters I monitor made this very point in June 2010, the month of BP’s post-spill low.

I am referring to the Turnaround Letter, edited by George Putnam. In the June 2010 issue of his newsletter, he asked if the challenges BP faces because of the spill are “really serious.” His answer:

“Of course. But has the market overreacted to it? We think that is quite likely. For example, BP will undoubtedly incur massive expenses and legal liability as a result of the spill, but our best guess is that the total bill will fall well short of the $55 billion hit that the [company’s market cap] has taken. Sure, there is loss of reputation to figure in as well, but BP remains one of the largest energy companies in the world with enormous assets and powerful marketing clout.”

It should be little surprise that Putnam’s letter has one of the best long-term records of any that I monitor. Over the last 20 years, according to my firm’s performance tracking, the Turnaround Letter has produced a 10.4% annualized return, versus 6.8% for the Wilshire 5000 index’s W5000, +0.13% total return.

Putnam continues to think BP is a good investment. In the latest issue of his newsletter, he rates the stock a “buy” so long as it’s trading for less than $55 per share. On Monday, it closed at $44.61.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bp-shares-hit-8-year-high-as-oil-rally-aids-profit-2018-05-01,"LONDON -- BP PLC shares rose to their highest level since 2010, boosted by frothy oil prices that have helped return the stock to levels not seen since the month after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

Like the handful of big oil firms that have already reported in recent days, London-based BP benefited handsomely from recently lofty oil prices. It also reported rising production, helping it post its strongest quarterly earnings since the middle of 2014.

Tuesday's solid first-quarter results could go some way toward convincing investors that BP's ambitious plan to regain its position among the world's top energy companies is gaining steam.

BP's shares rose more than 1% in early London trading, after touching a high of GBP5.48, or about $7.50. The last time the company's share price was at that level was in the immediate aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April 2010. The disaster killed 11 and sent oil spewing into the Gulf, resulting in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.

BP's shares hit a two-year high of GBP6.58 on April 21, 2010, the day after the explosion but before investors had a firm handle on the scale of the disaster. It quickly hurtled lower, hitting a low of GBP2.96 in June 2010.

Then-Chief Executive Tony Hayward resigned the following month, and BP started what would turn out to be a multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to recover. To pay for cleanup costs and legal fees, BP was forced to sell off billions of dollars in assets, dramatically shrinking the size of the company. To date, the spill has cost BP more than $65 billion.

It agreed to a landmark $20 billion deal to settle all federal and state claims for the accident in 2015. Since then, executives, including Chief Executive Bob Dudley, have tried to turn the page on the disaster. Part of that effort has been a plan to return its oil-and-gas production to 4 million barrels a day, while boosting profits and cash flow.

The company said Tuesday its replacement cost profit -- a number analogous to the net income that U.S. oil companies report -- was $2.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period a year earlier. The last time it reported profits of that size was in the third quarter of 2014 when oil prices were hovering near $100 a barrel.

In addition to its Deepwater Horizon woes, BP suffered with the rest of the industry through years of low oil prices. Oil prices fell to as low as about $25 a barrel by 2016, though have recovered strongly since then. International crude is now trading near $75 a barrel.

The company's production, meanwhile, rose 6% in the first quarter compared with a year ago. BP started a record number of new projects around the world last year and is planning to begin production at six more in 2018, part of a plan to add 900,000 barrels a day of new production by 2021. The strategy puts it on track to return output to its pre-Deepwater Horizon levels of around four million barrels a day, by the early 2020s. On Tuesday, it said it pumped 3.7 million barrels a day in the first quarter.

The company's Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary also raised the prospect that BP could consider raising its dividend in the second half of the year as it expects debt levels to come down. It kept its payout unchanged for the first quarter.

But BP still hasn't escaped the financial liabilities that have hobbled it since Deepwater Horizon. The company said it paid out $1.6 billion in the first quarter related to the accident. That included the final installment from a settlement with the Justice Department to resolve all criminal claims. In total, payments are expected to total just over $3 billion in 2018. The company then faces charges of about $2 billion next year, and then more than $1 billion a year out past 2030.

BP caps a mixed earnings season for the world's biggest oil companies. Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC posted their best first-quarter profits in years, but investors remained skeptical of companies that failed to meet expectations during three months when oil prices reached their highest level since 2014.

BP said production rose 6% in the first quarter compared with a year ago as the company continued to deliver on its strategy to return to its former size by the early 2020s.

However, debt levels crept higher as liabilities relating to the disaster continue to weigh on BP's performance. The company paid out $1.6 billion in the first quarter, including the final charge in a 2012 settlement with the Justice Department to resolve all criminal claims.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/03/2018/good-time-be-producing-oil,"This Is a Good Time to Be Producing Oil

I haven't written about crude oil in my Real Money column for a while, and that is indicative of the Pax Arabica that has hit the markets. The bust period of fall 2014 to spring 2016 seems so far away, and those saying oil is headed straight to $100 per barrel have also been proven wrong. Saudi seems intent on stabilizing the markets near these levels, and, as usual, many of the other OPEC countries are a mess politically. Add in benign inventory levels in the United States -- still about 20% below the year-ago figures despite this week's small increase -- and this is a good time to be producing crude. Stability is important.

The CBOE's measure of the volatility of crude oil futures prices, OVX, looks close to a flatline in the six month rendering, and that kind of boring market is a godsend to producers. Few understand this, but when a company produces a commodity it is actually effectively short that good in the intermediate term. It is the buyers that are really the longs, and thus the pressure is on the producers to put floors under their near-term production levels.

Predicting these levels is not an exact science, and I have met some in-house oil traders that I would love to compete with in games of chance. There are some pretty ugly hedge books out there, and the oil markets' continuing state of backwardation surprised some players. The amount of backwardation is at a workable level now, though. As of this writing, the front-month WTI contract is quoted at $68.53, the December 2018 contract is quoted at $66.45 and the August 2019 contract is quoted at $64.05. That still doesn't take into account the physical cost of storing the crude (which normally produces higher prices for future months contracts, a situation known as contango) but, really, if a company cannot make a positive return on capital at $64/barrel crude, it should be in another business.

So the discount that the oil exploration and production companies (E&Ps) are afforded by the markets owing to volatility of the underlying commodity prices is not warranted. The stock market just doesn't seem to grasp this Pax Arabica, and the bond markets are even worse.

The heightened volatility of the equities belies the peaceful state of the commodity markets, and that scares some away from my favored smaller E&Ps, such as Evolution Petroleum (EPM) , Denbury Resources (DNR) and Sanchez Energy (SN) . If you've missed the moves on those names, hopefully you have dipped into ""super-independents"" like Diamondback (FANG) or Pioneer (PES) or are long-term holders -- as I am -- of stable supermajors like Exxon (XOM) and BP (BP) . XOM is not exactly (AMZN) in terms of performance, I get it, but those dividend payments are a nice gift each and every quarter.

So, as an asset manager, it is an opportune time to lock in the cash flows from crude being produced with a positive margin. In my last RM column on energy I mentioned Sanchez Energy's 1/2023 Senior Notes and the 10% preferreds issued by Callon Petroleum (CPE-A) as two major holdings of my firm. I check the prices of those securities weekly, not hourly, and I plan on having my clients enjoy those elevated yields. Our yield on CPE-A is just under 10% and I bought the Sanchez bonds well, so we're getting a 17% annualized rate.

The cash flows from those securities allow me to sit back, relax, and completely ignore the daily machinations in the NYMEX oil pits. Life isn't that easy, though. As an energy investor one must always have a view on the intermediate term price of the commodity. My view: no change. That sentence could clearly qualify for the famous last words category, but the elevated yields my firm is receiving on these securities make boring actually a lucrative call on the markets.

As a corollary to the wise dictum ""haters gonna hate,"" commodity investors know that ""speculators gonna speculate."" Just ignore them and you'll do fine.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chevron-tanks-after-missing-estimates-14664652,"Chevron Corp. (CVX) erased losses on Friday, July 27, as its plans to repurchase $3 billion of stock per year overcame concern about missing second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates.

The San Ramon, Calif.-based oil major reported earnings of $3.4 billion, or $1.78 per share for the second quarter. Total revenues for the period came in at $42.24 billion. Those results fell short of forecasts calling for earnings of $2.09 per share on revenue of $45.66 billion, according to FactSet.

The company reported charges of $724 million for the quarter, up from $598 million a year ago, due to higher interest expense.

Chevron also said capital and exploratory expenditures were $9.2 billion for the first six months of the year, an increase from $8.9 billion a year ago. Expenditures for the company's upstream segment represented 88% of the total. Included in the quarter was a receivable write-down of $270 million charged to operating expense.

But the company with a market capitalization of $236 billion said cash flow from operations in the first half of the year rose to $11.9 billion, up from $8.7 billion during the same period a year earlier.

""Our cash flow continues to improve with higher upstream margins and volumes, combined with disciplined spending,"" Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth said in a statement. ""This enables us to initiate share repurchases, which are expected to be $3 billion per year based on our current outlook.""

Management said it will start the stock buyback program in the third quarter and expects the plan to be sustainable through any ""reasonable [oil] price environment.""

While the $3 billion per year buyback was below Credit Suisse's initial forecast of $4 billion per year, analyst William Featherston sees the ""scope for CVX to expand this target over time."" The firm rates Chevron at Neutral with a $138 price target.

Chevron earlier this week also announced a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, payable Sept. 10.

Shares of Chevron closed at $126.00, up 1.7%.

Net oil-equivalent production was 2.83 million barrels per day during the second quarter, up from 2.78 million barrels per day a year ago. Chevron said it now expects full-year production to be in the upper half of the guidance range of 4% to 7% growth.

Chevron's Executive Vice President of Upstream Jay Johnson said the company has restarted drilling in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale and has no intention of slowing development in the Permian fields of west Texas. Johnson also said the company expects production at its Big Foot deep-water drilling project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to begin later this year.

The Big Foot facilities are designed for a capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Big Foot is estimated to contain recoverable resources in excess of 200 million oil-equivalent barrels, Chevron said.

Chevron's conference call, in which management provided all of these production updates, stood in stark contrast to rival Exxon Mobil Corp.'s (XOM) call as analysts criticized management's lack of disclosure regarding scheduled maintenance, which CEO Darren Woods blamed for the company's earnings miss. Exxon made no mention of buying back stock, the catalyst for Chevron's gains today.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) on Friday, July 27, reported second quarter earnings of 92 cents per share, missing analysts' estimates of $1.27 per share. The company beat analysts' estimates on revenue, however, posting $73.5 billion versus the $71.4 billion expected by company watchers surveyed by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

Exxon's stock fell almost 3% to $81.91 share as trading began on Friday following the news.

Chairman and CEO Darren Woods blamed the quarter's lackluster results largely on ""scheduled maintenance to support operational integrity."" The chief executive also said its extended recoveries from first quarter operational incidents in its downstream segment were ""disappointing,"" even though it was pleased with the return to full production following an earthquake in Papua New Guinea.

Management echoed that sentiment on Friday's conference call with analysts, warning that maintenance would be heavier through the back half of 2018 and into 2019 than previous years.

Exxon would do well to better warn the market of specific future maintenance shutdowns to prevent the volatility in its stock, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate said during the Q&A segment of the call.

Houston-based Exxon's second quarter earnings of $4 billion represent a 20% increase over the $3.2 billion the company earned in the second quarter of 2017.

The company increased spending in 2018, noting Friday its capital and exploration expenditures were $6.6 billion, up 69% year over year due to investments in Brazil, west Texas' Permian Basin and Indonesia.

Exxon's upstream unit posted $3.04 billion in earnings during the second quarter, up $1.86 billion from the same quarter in 2017 but down $457 million sequentially.

And the company's downstream business earned $724 million, a $661 million decrease from a year ago and a $216 million drop from the prior quarter.

Finally, the company's chemicals segment posted $890 million in earnings, down $121 million from last quarter and $95 million from the same quarter last year.

Exxon on Friday reiterated a recent joint venture deal with Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) , which will construct a pipeline system to transport more than 1 million barrels of crude oil and condensate per day from multiple locations in the U.S. Permian Basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Investors over the past six months have raised concerns with the shipping difficulties in the Permian Basin, caused by a lack of necessary infrastructure to move crude from West Texas to export locations along the Gulf of Mexico.

These takeaway constraints have led to a widening of the gap, or differential, between the price of crude in Midland, Texas — the heart of the Permian basin — and Cushing, Okla., where U.S. crude futures are priced.

Heading into the second quarter earnings cycle, Seaport Global Securities LLC analysts said they will look to U.S. producers to better clarify the Permian differential and infrastructure concerns.

""We're still reticent on jumping back into the basin with both feet given the lack of clarity on how the space will look (and how investors will react) when actual physical constraints do come to fruition; we're not there yet despite the Mid-Cush differential hitting $16/bbl this week,"" the analysts wrote in a July 25 note to clients. ""We've heard compelling arguments for both the Armageddon scenario - shut-ins galore with no gas flaring allowed (see our CDEV note); and also for the all-clear scenario — the midstream industry saves the day with quicker-than-anticipated solutions.""",2018-07-27,Exxon

U.S. equity futures point to modest gains on Wall Street with GDP data as well as Q2 numbers from oil majors Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Phillips 66 in focus.

Market Snapshot

Global stocks edged higher Friday, with Wall Street set to cap the week with modest gains as investors take comfort from the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Brussels and focus on the underlying strength of the U.S. economy that reports suggest may have grown the most in four years last quarter.

Senate lawmakers also passed a bill last night that eliminates tariffs around 1,600 imported goods, many of them from China, in a move that suggests the White House could be urged to move beyond the headline rhetoric in its recent trade policies and take a more practical approach to solving disputes with its allies and competitors. This week's agreement on trade with the European Union, as well as comments yesterday from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the U.S. would ""negotiate with China anytime ... if they're willing to make serious changes just as the EU did yesterday"" also suggested a notable easing in tensions between Washington and Beijing.

With the U.S. economy likely having grown by more than 4% over the second quarter, the best pace in nearly four years, and Amazon Inc. ( AMZN ) rescuing the FAANG complex of tech stocks with blowout quarterly earnings last night that sent shares to a record high in after-hours trading, investors are expected to use the recent momentum to build on the market's relatively solid gains through the Friday session.

Early indications from U.S. equity futures show contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average are indicating a 50 point gain at the opening bell, while those linked to the S&P 500 suggest a 10.1 point advance for the broader benchmark. Nasdaq Composite futures are indicated 33.5 points higher.

Amazon's after-the-bell beat topped one of the busiest days of the earnings season yesterday, which saw 74 S&P 500 companies report quarterly updates, adding to the collective strength of U.S. corporate bottom lines. So far through this period, around 87% of the companies reporting so far have topped Wall Street estimates, with forecasts still calling for overall quarterly earnings growth of around 22%, one of the best three month periods of the past decade.

Amazon Inc. (AMZN) shares are set to open at a record high Friday after global online retailer posted much-stronger-than-expected second quarter earnings and said aggressive cost-cutting and higher-margin business would deliver forecast busting profits over the summer months.

Amazon shares were marked 4% higher in pre-market trading Friday, indicating an opening bell price of $1,880.10, an all-time high that would extend the stock's year-to-date gain to around 59% and value the group at just over $910 billion.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world's most-valuable company, will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on July 31. Its shares were marked 0.3% higher in pre-market trading at $194.75 each, valuing the Cupertino, Ca.based group at around $950 billion.

Twitter Inc. (TWTR) shares plunged in pre-market trading Friday after the social media group posted solid second quarter earnings and a robust outlook, but noted that changes to its content rules meant fewer people are using the microblogging website.

Twitter shares were marked 14.5% lower in pre-market trading in New York, indicating an opening bell price of $36.72 each, a move that would still leave the stock with a year-to-date gain of around 65%.

Oil majors Chevron (CVX) , Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Phillips 66 (PSX) will highlight Friday's lighter reporting calendar, with numbers also expected from Colgate-Palmolive and Merck & Co. (MRK)

European stocks were modestly stronger at the opening bell, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 index rising 0.32% by mid-day in Frankfurt as benchmarks in Germany and France traded modestly higher from last night's close as the euro drifted to 1.1645 against the dollar following yesterday's reiteration by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that interest rates won't begin to rise until the end of next summer.

Overnight in Asia, the moderate easing of trade tensions, alongside Amazon's strong full-year signalling, helped boosted regional stocks, with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rising 0.3% into the close of the session. In Japan, more reports that the central bank is ready to tweak its long-running program of quantitative easing put the yen under some pressure in foreign exchange markets and helped the Nikkei 225 book a 0.56% gain by the close of trading.

Away from equities, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a five-week high of 2.973% in overnight trading as investors anticipated today's GDP reading and some of the so-called ""carry trade"", in which investors fund purchases of U.S. government debt through cheap Japanese yen, faded as talk of a pullback in Bank of Japan stimulus increased.

""If this high US GDP print is more luck (rather than fundamental), then we won't be surprised to see a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' type of reaction - with the USD broadly weakening after the release,"" said ING economist Viraj Patel. ""Plus, one shouldn't forget that a strong US consumer isn't exactly bad news for the world economy or global risk appetite.""

Global oil prices eased in early New York trading, snapping a three day winning streak even as investors continue to eye developments in the Red Sea, where Saudi Arabia has suspended crude shipments amid concern for the safety of its tankers following attacks from rebel soldiers in Yemen, and a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude stocks published earlier this week by the Energy Information Administration.

Brent crude contracts for September delivery, the global benchmark, were seen 23 cents lower from their Thursday close in New York and changing hands at $74.31 per barrel in early European trading. WTI contracts for the same month were marked 22 cents lower at $69.39 per barrel.",2018-07-27,Amazon

1. -- Stocks Rise Ahead of GDP Report

U.S. stock futures rose modestly on Friday, July 27, as Wall Street prepared for a report that could show the U.S. economy grew the most in four years during the second quarter.

Economists expect gross domestic product to top a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter compared with the first quarter's 2%. The Commerce Department will release its first official estimate of second-quarter GDP at 8:30 a.m. ET. Consumer sentiment for June at 10 a.m. will round out Friday's U.S. economic calendar.

Investors also were taking comfort from the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Europe and a blowout quarter from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) .

Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 1.75 points and Nasdaq futures gained 12.75 points.

The Nasdaq fell more than 1% on Thursday, July 26, after social media giant Facebook Inc. (FB) dropped almost 19%, losing $120 billion in market capitalization and earning the dubious record for the worst one-day loss in market value in U.S. stock market history.

Merck & Co. (MRK) posted second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.06 a share, 3 cents ahead of estimates. Revenue rose to $10.47 billion from $9.93 billion, and beat forecasts of $10.28 billion.

Twitter Inc. (TWTR) shares plunged 14% in premarket trading Friday after the social media company posted solid second-quarter earnings and a robust outlook, but noted that changes to its content rules meant fewer people were using the microblogging website.

Colgate-Palmolive Inc.'s (CL) second-quarter adjusted earnings of 77 cents a share met analysts' forecasts. But sales of $3.87 billion came in below analysts' forecasts. The stock fell 3.5%.

2. -- Amazon.com's Profit Tops $2 Billion

Amazon.com Inc. rose 4.3% in premarket trading on Friday after the online retailing giant posted second-quarter earnings of $2.5 billion, or $5.07 a share, the first time Amazon topped $2 billion in quarterly profit.

Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.48 a share.

Revenue in the quarter was $52.9 billion, rising from $37.96 billion a year earlier but slightly below analysts' estimates of $53.37 billion. The company said sales growth accelerated in North America, internationally and at Amazon Web Services. AWS revenue rose 49% year over year to $6.11 billion, matching the first-quarter's growth rate and topping a consensus estimate of $5.98 billion.

Amazon said it expects third-quarter operating profit in a range of $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion vs. estimates of $1.28 billion. Revenue in the third quarter is expected at $54 billion to $57.5 billion, which is below consensus of $58.1 billion.

""Overall, we think this was another really good quarter for the company,"" said Cramer and the AAP team. ""The revenue miss and soft guidance does raise some red flags about top-line growth, but what impressed us the most is how quickly Amazon can turn up profitability thanks to an increase sales mix towards AWS, subscriptions, and advertising.""

3. -- Intel Slides Despite Earnings Beat

Intel Corp. (INTC) fell 6.8% in premarket trading despite an earnings beat in the chipmaker's second quarter.

Intel reported adjusted earnings of $1.04 a share on revenue of $16.96 billion, beating analysts' expectations of 96 cents a share on revenue of $16.76 billion.

According to Intel, the nearly $17 billion in sales during the period was a company record. As a result, the company raised its full-year revenue guidance by about $2 billion to $69.5 billion, and raised adjusted guidance by 30 cents a share to $4.15 a share.

Downsides: The company said data-center revenue in the quarter jumped 27% from a year earlier to $5.5 billion but was below analysts' forecasts of $5.61 billion, and said one of its key next generation chips wouldn't be released until next year.

4. -- Sales at Starbucks Rise 11%

Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) earned 62 cents a share on an adjusted basis in its fiscal third quarter, 1 cent above Wall Street estimates. The stock fell slightly in premarket trading on Friday.

Sales at the coffee retailer rose 11% to $6.31 billion from $5.66 billion a year earlier. Analysts were looking for sales of $6.26 billion. Global comparable-store sales rose 1%, meeting estimates.

The company lowered its expectations for fiscal global same-store sales growth to just below 3%, from its previous estimate of 3% to 5%. Watch a quick analysis of the quarter below.

5. -- Chipotle Tops Profit Forecasts

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) jumped 6.1% in premarket trading on Friday after the better burrito chain reported second-quarter earnings that topped expectations.

Revenue rose 8.3% to $1.27 billion while comparable-restaurant sales in the quarter rose 3.3%.

Meanwhile, new Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol, the former Taco Bell chief who took over in March, told TheStreet his company would soon begin piloting a ""late-night"" menu, serving up $2 tacos and a drink after 8 p.m.

Artistic Interpretation

By Friday, we'll have in possession our first look at the second quarter of 2018 from an economic growth perspective. Hopes and expectations are for an annualized print that at least starts with a 4. You see that 4 handle? It won't matter much whether or not the president speaks openly on monetary policy. Hands will be tied and the FOMC will continue to move on rates. Futures markets traded in Chicago are now pricing in an 89% chance of a third 2018 rate hike in late September, as well as a probability of 58% for that fourth and final hike of the year in December.

Like a president that likely feels it necessary to tackle inequities in global trade while the economy is hot, the Fed Chair probably also feels the need to normalize policy as much as possible at the same time. Is this the breakaway velocity for economic growth that both Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen spoke of, and hoped for in years past? Do these actions ultimately put to death a recovery that until now had lasted longer, but accomplished far less than economic recoveries experienced in the wake of past recessions? You just do not know, You can not know.

You see, the problem with economics is that it is simply not science. Economics is art. In science, the same outcome can be expected under the same circumstances without fail. At the bottom of it all, simplistically, economics becomes the measured result of human response to both authentic and artificial conditions of surplus and scarcity. Economics -- both from a policy setting perspective, as well as from the view of models that assign credit and blame for impact -- is left open to interpretation. You and I must remain ever vigilant, and ever flexible.

Taping On The Foil

Second-quarter earnings at this point are well underway. The earliest couple of weeks of ""the season"" have been dominated by the financials, and the season appears to be humming. Though early growth for both earnings and revenue seem to be running slightly above expectation, the week starts off a little on the slow side, but heats up quickly with the release of Alphabet's (GOOGL) numbers tonight. Less in focus tonight will be the actual quarterly data, and more in focus will be comments made on items like target acquisition costs, Europe's new data privacy rules and the recent $5 billion antitrust fine imposed by the EU. In other words, I think the stock will rise or fall based on expectations for second-half margins.

As for the rest of this week, of the 500 names that comprise the S&P 500, we look for results from 182 of them, or about 36.4% of the whole kit and caboodle. The focus, at least for this trader, will be well spread out across favored sectors, including many well known semiconductor names, payment leaders and some energy plays. Perhaps most in focus for me will be aerospace and defense. Lockheed Martin (LMT) , Boeing (BA) , Northrop Grumman (NOC) , General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) will all report sometime between this Tuesday and this Thursday. I am long each and every one of them. For now.

About Oil

Oil Services giant Schlumberger SLB reported quarterly data on Friday. As you well know by now, the firm posted a decent quarter, but did miss expectations on the revenue side -- despite 11% growth year over year. That, however was not the focus. The SLB call, well known across the industry as much for its honest assessment of the state of the planet's oil markets as it is for anything else, provided CEO Paal Kibsgaard's view on the demand/supply equation.

When WTI Crude failed to retake the $74 level, I warned on $66 crude. A stronger dollar acted on oil much as an anchor might, and took the commodity pretty darned close to that spot. Kibsgaard's commentary was more about problems facing the supply side than anything else. Concerns over the lack of pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin that impede record high U.S. production from efficiently reaching market to the geopolitical roadblocks that could weaken the supply base, despite OPEC's recent announcements on ramping up production. Those geopolitical concerns would cover sanctions against sales of Iranian Oil as well as inconsistent flows that run out of Venezuela and Libya.

Where Are We?

Well, by now I am sure that you have noticed the war of words between Iran's President Hassan Rouhani and U.S. President Trump last night. First, Rouhani threatened the U.S. with eternal regret should the U.S. president continue with a policy that denies Iran the ability to sell its oil globally. The U.S. president responded to these threats of eternal regret with his own threats of a historical response. Hence, geopolitical risk.

The bottom line for me is that the IEA has forecast global demand that will average 99.1 million barrels per day this year, which should rise to 100.5 million barrels per day next year. Global supply averaged around 98.8 million barrels per day last month. This all supports what Paal Kibsgaard is trying to tell us. Significant increases need to be made in exploration and production investment. My longs in that space are Exxon Mobil (XOM) , British Petroleum (BP) , and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) .

Why these three? Well, we could easily go broader than three names. These happen to be three names that I have traded with some positive result in the past, that all appear to me to be well positioned going into earnings. We'll hear from RDS.A on Thursday, and XOM on Friday. BP steps to the plate next week.

All three of these names offer significant dividend to the investor, all three trade at forward-looking P/E ratios below that not only of the S&P 500 (17.5x, source: Barrons), but also that of the Energy Sector (17.1x, source: Yardeni). All three sport levered free cash flows well into the positive for billions of dollars, and at least BP and RDS.A can show of current ratios greater than one.

Royal Dutch Shell

First off, Royal Dutch Shell currently runs with the lowest forward looking PE (10.6x), strongest current ratio (1.2x), second-highest levered free cash flow -- and ties for top yielding dividend (5.4%) of these three names.

What the chart tells me is that we have a series of higher lows coupled with successively lower highs... typical of a stock facing some kind of imminent violence with indicating directional favor. Both the daily MACD, and the Chaikin Money Flow seem to be pulling higher, while Relative Strength remains non-committal. The name could be about three quarters of the way into a cup and handle formation that would complete around the time in August that the blue trend lines would collide.

For my money (and I'm talking about my money, you do what you want), the name is worth an equity long, especially given the payout. Those looking for the shelter of support previously seen at 50% retracement level seen in June could write an August 24 66.50 put. That product went out on Friday with a $0.50 bid ($1.19 last) due to a tiny open interest. A trader willing to play the name into year's end could probably write the January 62.50 puts for about $1.45. Just some food for thought.

CEO Marillyn Hewson announced that the company will be investing $100 million in worker training and educational opportunities over the next five years. Additionally, the company plans to spend $50 million to support the STEM Scholarship Fund and another $5 million toward apprenticeship and vocational opportunities.

""We are very excited about the opportunity to participate in this initiative. We think it is the right strategy,"" Hewson said during an interview on FOX Business.

State Street Buys Financial Data Firm Charles River for $2.6 Billion

Asset manager State Street has purchased financial data firm Charles River for $2.6 billion, bolstering the State Street's analytic tools capabilities.

Helping pay for the deal is State Street's decision to cancel plans to repurchase $950 million in company stock.

Charles River runs a software platform that is used by more than 300 customers and had revenue of more than $300 million last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart to Launch Video Subscription Service This Year

Variety reported that Walmart (WMT) is taking its rivalry with Amazon to the entertainment sector, launching a video subscription service through its Vudu digital entertainment division.

It has been reported that Walmart will price Vudu at $8 per month, giving it a cheaper product than both Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) .

Walmart acquired Vudu in 2010. The platform currently offers 150,000 movies to buy or rent on demand. The service is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.

Judge Dismisses NYC Lawsuit Against Big 5 Oil Companies

A federal judge ruled that the city of New York doesn't have a case against BP (BP) , Chevron (CVX) , ConocoPhillips (CP) , Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) , and those companies don't have an obligation to pay for the potential effects of climate change.

The city argued that those companies were responsible for more than 11% of all industrial carbon dioxide and methane emissions since the Industrial Revolution.

""We have said all along that addressing the risks of climate change is a serious global challenge that should be addressed by policymakers and not by the courts,"" Scott Silvestri, a media relations manager for Exxon said in a statement.

Papa John's Loses Another Sports Partnership

The fallout from former Papa John's (PZZA) CEO John Schnatter's disastrous conference call continues to hurt the company after the NBA's Utah Jazz franchise decided to end its partnership with the pizza company.

The Jazz has joined the Seattle Seahawks and New York Yankees have also severed ties with the company after it was revealed that Schnatter used the ""n-word"" during a conference call about his response to the NFL anthem protest.

The current agreement includes promotions like fans getting 50% off regular priced pizzas the day after Jazz victories.

https://www.thestreet.com/markets/ibm-claws-ahead-in-the-cloud-14656264,"IBM (IBM) backers are on cloud nine.

The computer giant's cloud business helped the company top Wall Street expectations, in the first second-quarter earnings report from the leading cloud computing providers.

Shares of IBM were gaining 2.6% to $148.30 on Thursday. The company reported second quarter earnings of $3.08 per share after the close on Wednesday, topping forecasts of $3.04.

However, one rule of thumb in the fast-growing cloud computing sector is that results can be a little ... cloudy. For the last 12 months, IBM said its cloud revenue grew 23%, or 20% adjusting for currency changes, to $18.5 billion. During that time, the company landed new cloud clients ExxonMobil (XOM) , Amtrak and Telefónica (TEF) .

IBM's figure includes $8.2 billion in sales of hardware software and services to companies that are setting up hybrid clouds, which blend privately-operated clouds with services from public cloud providers such as Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform. IBM's revenues from various cloud products billed ""as a service"" came to $10.4 billion for the last 12 months.

""Similar to several of its peers, IBM doesn't make it clear and obvious from its earnings call material what the scale and trajectory are for the key cloud market segments,"" John Dinsdale of Synergy Research Group wrote in an email.

However, Dinsdale noted, IBM ""continues to do quite well"" in cloud infrastructure services. The company maintained its global market share at about 8%, Synergy estimates.

""Because [IBM] doesn't focus as much on the more glitzy and media-oriented public [infrastructure-as-a-service] segment, it doesn't get the same level of attention and press coverage as AWS, Microsoft, Google and Alibaba (BABA) ,"" Dinsdale said. ""But it continues to do very well in hosted private cloud services and in certain [platform-as-a-service] areas.""

IBM's longer-term turnaround remains in doubt, however, as it struggles to de-emphasize slower-growing legacy businesses. Shares are down 8% over the last two years and 23% over the last five years.

The cloud rankings will be clearer in a week. Microsoft reports after the close on Thursday (TheStreet will be live-blogging the earnings report and call; check our our home page for more details). And next week, Alphabet will provide numbers on Google Cloud Platform on Monday and Amazon will report on its market-leading Amazon Web Services next Thursday.

IBM's Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh touted that his firm is becoming ""the destination for mission-critical workloads in hybrid environments"" during IBM's earnings call after-hours on Wednesday.

IBM's Strategic Imperatives unit, which includes its cloud business, grew 15% to $10.1 billion in the second quarter and accounted for just more than half of IBM's $20 billion in sales.

While the new, strategic lines of businesses are growing, Jeffrey Kvaal of Nomura in a Thursday report that there is a catch. ""Some of the growth in Strategic Imperatives comes at the expense of legacy segments...and legacy seems able to decline just fine on its own,"" Kvaal wrote.

While IBM is ""hardly firing on all cylinders"" amid declines in older businesses, Kvaal raised his target from $160 to $170 per share because of confidence that Big Blue can return to ""sustained growth.""

Kvaal took Kavanaugh's statement that IBM is becoming a ""destination of choice"" for cloud services with a grain of salt. ""While this surely can be debated, IBM did back up its statement by citing competitive wins at Amtrak and Exxon Mobile,"" he wrote.

A Very ""Consistent"" 47 Days

Way back on June 1 (about six weeks ago), Richard Templeton stepped aside as president and CEO of Texas Instruments (TXN) (he had stayed on as chairman). Templeton made way for Brian Crutcher to take the helm. Crutcher, who had been with the firm since 1996, had filled the role of COO since January of 2017. This morning, Richard Templeton resumed his roles as president and chief executive in addition to the his title as Chair.

What happened to that other guy? Here we go again. Crutcher resigned last night. A statement made by the Dallas-based firm indicated that Crutcher had violated the company's code of conduct, and that these violations were related to personal behavior, not corporate strategy, nor operations. The shares have been volatile overnight and are now off of their ""pajama time"" lows. Along with this news, the firm had the foresight to release second-quarter earnings information (due July 24) alongside this negative news event. TXN posted profit of $1.40 per share (in line with whisper numbers) versus consensus expectations of $1.31. The firm also showed revenue of $4.02 billion (+9% y/y), which was up versus expectations of $3.95 billion.

How troubling is this to a semiconductor industry still reeling from the exit of former Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich at that firm? (That one hurt) According to the Wall Street Journal, in May, Brian Crutcher had been asked at a conference what it was that he would bring to this company. Crutcher, ironically, mentioned ""consistency.""

Well, those looking for consistency from Texas Instruments can thank their lucky stars that a leader such as Richard Templeton was ready and willing to resume his multiple roles in a permanent way on short notice. This is likely the larger reason that the shares sort of held their own overnight, more so than the early release of the positive financial data.

Time to Pile Back Into the Semis?

Good question. If you're like me, you hung onto partials across the space just to maintain a certain level of exposure amid a trade war with China. We all know that many of the most highly exposed U.S. corporates to China-based revenue streams are indeed semiconductor stocks. The banks seem to have gotten ""earnings season"" off to pretty solid start. They say that this sets the tone for the entire season. I say that they talk too much. Let's focus here. In truth, I have been trying to add to several of my holdings in the semiconductor industry group while maintaining technical discipline. If you read me often, then you know that I've never chased anything. Except for my pretty wife.

As a sector, Info Tech is expected to post a solid quarter. I have been looking for a second quarter that posts year-over-year EPS gains for the S&P 500 of something in the area of 19% to 20%. Info Tech should see something closer to 25%. Within the sector, as an industry, semis and semiconductor equipment manufacturers are expected to place second to software (the cloud), and show gains of more than 30%. I would look for the industry to back this up with revenue growth of more than 15%.

The bottom line is that earnings are historical. We know that the chips as a group have earned their keep. Over the last three months, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has underperformed the broader market due to trade concerns with China. No other reason.

Using the S&P 500 as a baseline, one immediately sees the overperformance of the Nasdaq Composite, and underperformance of the SOX versus the SPX over that time. Note: Performance is simply relative versus the S&P 500, not versus the starting point.

How I Am Tackling This

The very first thing I notice is that China has been slow to retaliate versus the semis in this trade dispute. Yes, some of these names are highly exposed, but China needs them as much as they need China -- maybe even more so. This will not be a permanent condition. The Chinese government will speed toward a decreased reliance upon U.S. chips while dragging their feet on policy. China's aim was to be far more self sufficient by the year 2025. That's why intellectual property rights are such a hot topic.

What can China do, other than impose increased responsive tariffs on the group? China, in case you have been living in a cave, is in a bit of a debt jam. Who isn't? However, should the Chinese government decide to devalue the currency, that would make imports more expensive, and exports less so -- while also making yuan-denominated debt easier to pay. Not a permanent solution to anything, but a weapon that a nation currently in over its head in a trade war might use. So, this is my plan.

1) Equipment. I got rid of Applied Materials (AMAT) as trade war tensions increased. Probably the best move I've made in the space. I have been trying to add to Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) on the dip. From a trading perspective, LRCX has formed the best base. All three are highly exposed to China. Lam's earnings are due a week from tomorrow. I know of no CEO that lays it on the line as honestly as Martin Anstice of Lam. Until I hear his voice on that call, I will trade more, invest less.

In the meantime, KLAC August 17 $100 puts still paid more than $2 yesterday. That name found support at the $100 and $98 levels on each of the last two dips. Just an idea.

2) Memory. Who doesn't love Micron Technology (MU) ? I know I do. Still I have my entire equity long covered through the sale of call options. What's that do? Raises revenue, while further reducing my already favorable basis. The risk, other than equity risk? The shares get called away. Still, even in that event, I ring the register. I have not touched Western Digital (WDC) , and am not sure I plan to. The name has been a real dog, and does not compare well to any other name in the group.

3) GPUs. The champ here? Nividia (NVDA) ? No, not so far this year. Intel (INTC) ? At least they pay you something for your equity stake. The champ is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) . I can't boast here. Your old pal swung and missed 25% ago. That name has returned 64% on the year (really all since April). Just tread lightly. AMD does appear to have hit resistance, and all three of these names face high levels of Chinese exposure. NVDA is an Action Alerts Plus holding.

4) Left Field. There is only one chip stock that I have not sold a share of this year. Seagate Technology (STX) . The shares have gone sideways since March. Why own these? Two reasons: not a lot of Chinese exposure, and they pay me 4.3% just to own the shares. STX has always paid well, even in tough times. Oh also, they are exposed to crypto. Keep that in mind.

The Sarge Plan:

Looking to initiate: AMD -- but I need my price.

Looking to increase: LRCX, KLAC, MU, NVDA from current 50% of intended position size to 65% -- only at my levels, even if I whiff.

Looking to decrease: INTC from 50% to 25% hopefully in mid $50s. Will consider adding upon new CEO designation.

Don't Care For Now: WDC, TXN

Just Keep Paying Me: STX

Quickly On Oil

This article is already getting long. I'll be fast. WTI Crude is closing in on the $66 level (That I warned you about last Thursday) in the wake of last night's API data. If we see inventory data today that pressures the commodity, I become more likely to add to my exploration longs this afternoon -- Exxon Mobil (XOM) , Royal Dutch (RDS.A) , and Action Alerts Plus holding British Petroleum (BP) .

Odd? Not exactly explains Goldman Sachs. The investment bank points out in a new note (see charts below) the divergence in energy equities vs. the S&P 500 vs. oil futures remains at its widest in at least 17 years. Some top oil stocks continue to be, well, underground this year.

Baker Hughes GE (BHGE) is down slightly on the year, Exxon Mobil (XOM) has shed 3.3% and Action Alerts PLUS holding Schlumberger (SLB) is lower by 4%.

As Goldman Sachs puts it, investors remain lukewarm on oil stocks likely on fears of a trade war fueled global demand slowdown. With China's economic growth slowdown confirmed this week and the U.S. expansion likely cooling in the third quarter, muted appetite to own oil stocks is logical.

Here is how neatly Goldman breaks it down:

""Demand is key for equities. While the sum of each of the 3 D's will be key to oil inventories vs. the five-year average (we broadly expect slightly below average inventories on a days-of-demand basis - for the equities demand is more important. We believe there is greater likelihood of increased interest from generalist investors if oil prices are rangebound and demand is above trend, whereas if there is concern demand growth is going to slow to trend/below trend there may be more hesitation in incremental investment in Energy equities.""

Goldman does say the prospect for strong capital return plans by oil companies is proably being under-priced by investors. A silver lining to be sure, albeit a small one.",2018-07-17,Goldman Sachs
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/07/15/2018/5-ways-trump-putin-meeting-could-weigh-oil-prices,"5 Ways the Trump-Putin Meeting Could Weigh on Oil Prices

President Trump's unspoken agenda in the upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki could bring the following high-stakes diplomacy catalysts for crude oil prices and energy markets:

Future of Economic Sanctions Over Ukraine Intervention

Trump is likely to remain firm on Russia's economic sanctions issue as a political tool to leverage key issues for the United States, such as Russia-Saudi Arabia relationships on crude oil supply agreements, meddling with the U.S. elections and the future relationship of Russia with Ukraine and the European Union.

As we saw during the NATO summit, Trump's sour point on Russia is natural gas exports to Europe, where Gazprom (OGZPY) is a big player. Putin may seek relief from Russian economic sanctions, which have prevented a company such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) from carrying on its Russian arctic drilling program, partnership with Rosneft.

North Korea Support for Coal Black-Market Supply

Trump is likely to put pressure on Russia for facilitating black-market purchases of coal from North Korea. In regards to coal, Glencore (GLNCY) is one of the large coal commodity traders with a strong presence Colombia, South Africa and Australia. Glencore was recently subpoenaed by the U.S. government on alleged FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

We'd remind investors that one of Glencore's largest shareholders is the Emirate of Qatar, currently taking a contentious stand against the rest of Gulf Cooperation Countries, which could add political pressure.

Russian Support of Assad

Trump is likely to pressure Russia to reduce Iran's presence in Syria. The U.S. has been backing opposition forces in Syria, while Russia has continued to support the current regime of Bashar al-Assad. If the talks during the summit are negative toward Syrian peace-making, it could lead to a bullish signal for crude oil, given the involvement of Russia and Iran, which both currently are under sanctions by the U.S. in OPEC+ supply agreements.

Our best Middle East E&P play is Genel Energy (GEGYF) which is a growing oil producer in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Iran Sanctions, a Bullish Sign for Crude Oil Prices

Iran has a weak position among OPEC members due its current economic sanctions from the U.S., adding uncertainty to the OPEC production balance and a potential bullish signal for crude oil prices. Iran currently exports 2.61 MM bbl/d to the world markets.

Our best crude oil tanker play is the John Fredriksen-controlled Frontline Ltd. (FRO) , one of the largest crude oil tanker companies in the world. Iran's largest leverage is its unspoken control of the Strait of Hormuz, which is the pathway to all crude oil and LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargoes coming from the Middle East. However, the future of Iran's sanctions is a mixed catalyst for crude oil prices as Saudi Arabia is picking up additional production from countries including Iran and Venezuela, thus strengthening its position.

Russia-Saudi Arabia Collaboration on Crude Oil Price Stabilization

Exxon Mobil is the one of the oil majors with most exposure to Saudi Arabia's crude oil production, along with Halliburton (HAL) . In addition, Exxon has a significant partnership with the Qatar for the development of its LNG.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/07/12/2018/5-critical-things-not-overlook-todays-trading-market-recon,"5 Critical Things Not to Overlook in Today's Trading: Market Recon

Focus on Oil

As I set about to try to make a few bucks yesterday, I was fully aware that the President of the United States was in Brussels and that the NATO summit could get a little dicey. I had known about the prep work being done on an additional tranche of Chinese imports since the night before. I knew that U.S. equity markets were short-term overbought, and was mentally prepared for some risk off behavior. Bet you were too.

As for commodities, it would have been normal to expect some weakness around the growth-related issues that a potential trade war and some dollar strength could provoke. What I did not see coming was a 5% drop in WTI Crude pricing. That one hit me square in the forehead. I watched with astonishment as most of the televisions near my spot showed England play Croatia in their World Cup match. Nobody around me seemed to notice the full dollar handle for WTI fail (again) at the 74 level. Then it came quick. The 73, 72, and 71 handles all folded like a cheap suit on a humid day.

Now, I had to act. My oil names were still above basis, and I do not like to violate basis, at least not with equity. Rather than play games on the options side, these decisions are made on the spot. My instincts roared. Would the $70 level hold? So it would. Sort of. For now. I had added to a few of my oil longs. At least Exxon Mobil (XOM) , and what used to be known as British Petroleum (BP) (an Action Alerts Plus holding) from the exploration / production side, and Halliburton (HAL) from the services side.

In the case of the latter, I actually have been forced to defend basis. I also considered digging in on my other energy longs (Action Alerts Plus holding Schlumberger (SLB) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) ), but in truth, I am exposed enough on those names. All I need is a small bounce across the space this morning, and I will bounce right out of these three partials.

But what are the prospects now for Crude?

Roadblocks

Honestly, I had expected to see $80 WTI. I really thought that we would end up seeing $74 support. Survey says .. XXX. News that the state-run Libyan entity National Oil Corp had regained control of its eastern ports -- and that production from that country could increase by up to 700,000 barrels per day -- cut through market prices for crude like a hot knife through butter. The EIA reported that U.S. inventories dropped by an astounding 12.6 million barrels in one week. That mattered not one bit.

On top of the news from Libya, Saudi Arabia announced that the kingdom had increased production in June to levels close to two-year highs. This was even more important than tough talk on trade. It would appear that the fundamental news flow had changed direction.

In addition to all this, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be weighing waivers for sanctions on Iran around oil production, and then there is simple dollar strength. This is a lot to overcome. The $74 level, if not already obvious as significant resistance, now seems laid in cement. The level for potential support becomes key. You might expect to see a technical rebound early today. Should that stall around $72 ( a level this past Spring), the slope becomes all that much more slippery -- and $66 would not, at least to me, seem to be all that unrealistic.

Rapid Fire

Incredibly, with all of these high-profile headlines banging off of every wall, many usually important items seem almost overlooked, but would still be key to investors.

1) Yesterday's U.S. Treasury auction of $22 billion worth of 10-year notes went off a whole lot better than did the auction of three-year notes the day prior. Indirect bidders took down about $14.3 billion of the issue. This afternoon, the U.S. Treasury will sell off $14 billion worth of 30-year paper.

2) Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating yesterday for Amazon (AMZN) . Is that a big deal? I don't know. Nowak looks for earnings before interest and taxes for the ""death star"" to run at $5.4 billion for the second quarter, and $6.4 billion for Q3. Those numbers are well above Wall Street consensus. The big deal (that caught my attention) was the $2,600 number that Nowak threw around -- not as a price target, but as a possibility based on prospects for the continued growth of Amazon Web Services. Huzzah. AMZN is an Action Alerts Plus holding.

3) This morning's Core CPI figures matter. Big Time. Futures markets in Chicago are currently pricing in a 60% probability of a fourth 2018 rate hike in December. You add 50 basis points to the Fed Funds rate, what does that do to the 2-year note? Will a trade war further dampen expectations for growth? Inflation is key.

4) Broadcom (AVGO) announced late Wednesday that the firm had agreed to acquire CA Technologies (CA) (You older kids know this as Computer Associates. That one used to have some crowd.) for $18.9 billion in cash. That comes to a market price of $44.50. Does this heat up the software space? The cloud? It would be nice. We'll see.

5) The banks were down as a group yesterday, but in general, outperformed the broader market just ahead of earnings. The yield curve, of course, is no help here, but there is certainly reason for optimism (buybacks aside) ahead of the numbers. The group's behavior this afternoon should be key to quite a few P/Ls. I am probably focused on investment banking and trading revenue (Wall Street stuff) as much as loan growth, as there is just not as much money to be made in lending as had been anticipated.

Coring An Apple

So Apple (AAPL) takes a 1.3% hit on trade-related news, while the S&P 500 walks back a more pedestrian 0.7%. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, thought to be highly exposed to this type of threat, gave up (-0.9%) less ground than did AAPL. Does America's most-valued corporation have a problem?

Foxconn Technology operates out Taiwan. Right? Hmm. Here's the deal, gang. Apple operates 40 retail stores in China. At first glance, AAPL is not among the most-exposed U.S. corporations to Chinese revenue, but close to 20% of the firm's revenue is from the region, and Beijing could try to enforce its influence as the nation loses its ability to match the Trump administration on tariffs tit-for-tat.

Though President Trump has promised Tim Cook that iPhones manufactured in China will go untouched by these taxes for now, the Chinese government will certainly be able to interfere with supplies of parts and labor. In other words, Apple is exposed.

Unlike the other FAANG names, Apple is not insulated from current conditions. This will likely suppress the share price until good news breaks, in my opinion. It would not take much for Beijing to put the full weight of its support behind a firm like Huawei Technologies.

Huawei just happens to be the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturing company in the world -- and on top of that, it just happens to be Chinese. That firm was founded, and is run, by a former Chinese army officer, and has been labeled by the major U.S. intelligence agencies as ""effectively an arm of the Chinese government.""

For those holding the shares, there is good news. An Andrews' Pitchfork stretching back more than two years remains unbroken.

Even on a much shorter timeline, it becomes obvious that the stock's performance is ruled by technical factors more than anything else. My thought? If you're wearing these, you can probably keep a brave face until the 181 level cracks. That's where one would have to decide to either take their marbles and go home or add. AAPL reports after the closing bell on Tuesday, July 31.

Last night, July 27 182.50 puts were still paying $1.10. The July 27 180 puts (even safer) paid $0.71. Know what? Seventy-one bucks pays for a nice lunch for you and a pal. If you have to choke in these, you will have picked them up at a basis of 179 and change, and there looks to be some more support around $177.

First, remember that markets are staring at potentially growth-strangling news on international trade, uneven Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signals on oil production and a yield curve that seems just a little bit flatter every time we look.

Watch more on the yield curve below.

The news on trade keeps on getting dicier and dicier -- a significant threat to both continued U.S. and global economic growth scenarios. But unlike most of the pundits that I see on TV, I don't blame President Trump.

The playing field has obviously become badly slanted against U.S. exporters over several decades, and if we're going to tackle this long-term problem, the only time to try would be in an expanding U.S. economy. In addition, threats only work if those you're negotiating with believe you might actually carry them out.

However, we also face inconsistent messages from OPEC on oil output. And don't forget that a flatter yield curve must absorb $40 billion a month of Treasury bonds beginning in July thanks to an increase in the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening.

In theory, that could push rates in the right direction for the banks - but we don't know how much the bond market will play along. After all, it's the market that ultimately has veto power over almost all other performance.

Stocks are going to have rely on good earnings to work around all of these roadblocks. Fortunately, second-quarter earnings estimates have actually been firming up as we approach earnings season's launch in mid-July.

For now, analysts expect all 11 of the S&P 500's sectors to report year-over-year growth for both earnings and revenue. Market watchers once again expect top sectors for gains to include energy, materials and tech space. Unfortunately, materials and tech are two areas that would be heavily impacted any international-trade disputes.

How to Tackle This Environment

Strict discipline is the key to survival in this situation.

It's important to:

Understand. You must understand that all victories and defeats are temporary. That's actually tough for many people to do.

Identify. Always identify targets of opportunity and potential threats.

Adapt. Be ready to adapt to all environments. Never beat yourself.

Overcome. Have no fear -- ever. Focus only on cold preparation.

Maintain. Stick with methods that favor EQ over IQ.

Never Fall in Love. Don't love a stock, as it will never love you back. If you can't remove emotion from your decision-making on when to buy or sell, then you can't run your own money.

Take Baby Steps. You must initiate even well-thought-out positions with care. Entries are best made in small steps. I like to exit a stock that way, too.

Have a Road Map. Have a target sale price and a stop-loss panic point for any stock you buy. Know where you want to go and where you don't.

Stay Focused. Limit the number of active positions that you have. Write a mission statement for your investing endeavors and place it where you can see it.

Here's how I'm playing things in different sectors as July begins:

Energy

I'm still long here. I like core oil-services companies like Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) . I also have stakes in oil exploration through Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) .

Technology

I've lightened up on tech a great deal, largely by selling some of my semiconductor positions. I'm much lighter on my former faves Nvidia (NVDA) , Intel (INTC) and Lam Research (LRCX) and have exited Applied Materials (AMAT) completely.

However, I'm still long in full on Micron (MU) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) . I'm also still a strong believer in cloud computing, so I'm long Adobe (ADBE) , Amazon (AMZN) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Salesforce (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK) . That said, I'm kind of stuck in the middle on all of these -- too far above basis to add on weakness. So, that leaves me playing in and out of options in this space.

Elsewhere

I haven't sold any of my favorite defense-contractor stocks such as Boeing (BA) , and I've actually dug in some on them. I still believe in my thesis of an ever-riskier world, although it appears to have stopped working for my defense stocks for now.

Meanwhile, I've added back on to my retailer stocks now that they've sold off. Please recall that I let some air out of the tires near the highs on these names.

Lastly, I'm still long on some banks, although I don't love this space. In fact, I'm much more active in options related to banks than I am in bank stocks themselves.

A strong non-farm payrolls report offset the dual implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and China Friday, and the U.S markets continued to sail upwards on their merry way. If there's a wall of worry out there anymore, it is certainly a very short one, and as an active asset manager that's a challenge. Owing to reinvestment of dividends, interest payments, portfolio reconstruction and the injection of new client monies, I always have extra funds to invest.

Short-term money is now yielding more than the S&P 500, finally, with three-month LIBOR at 2.34% and the S&P's yield at 1.81%, but the flat yield curve means that 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield only 2.82% and 30-year Treasuries yield just 2.94%. I don't get paid to hold cash, and my clients would not be happy with sub-3% returns in a market of inflated equity pricing, so that means decisions have to be made.

Read Tom Graff's take on Friday's jobs report and the Fed here.

Other than ""wall of worry"" my second least-favorite market cliche, is ""risk-on/risk-off"" when used to describe the market zeitgeist on any given day. It's a risk-on world, and $34 billion worth of dual tariffs (with more in the comments stage) is not enough to move the needle for the markets as a whole.

If you are a risk-off person, it can feel like the great Redd Foxx as Fred Sanford portraying his endless series of fake heart attacks. Trade war with China: ""This is the big one."" North Korea tensions: ""Elizabeth I'm coming to join you."" Higher interest rates/flattening yield curve ""Arrrrgh.""

All of Fred's coronary episodes were fake and all of the perceived bogeymen on equities have been just as misleading as seeing the junkyard owner clutching his chest.

There is only one thing that can stop this train -- in terms of intermediate term direction, not day-to-day moves -- and that is weakness in earnings. Here, it's important to know the craft of an equity researcher. As my director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette used to tell us, an earnings note should be composed of 10% analysis on the reported quarter and 90% analysis on management's guidance for future quarters. Equities are forward-looking accounting mechanisms, and the future is always more important than the past.

So, from a broad view, it's important to know what your stocks are due to report in the season that begins in earnest next week. The first analysis should always be sectoral, so here are bullet points on a few sectors of interest:

Energy

Oil prices whether measured by the European benchmark Brent or the U.S. WTI are higher than they were one month, one quarter, and most importantly for earnings analysis, one year ago today. Do not overthink that one. If you have exposure in your portfolio to companies that produce black oil or service companies that do, you should not even consider selling them. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are the safest long-term plays here.

Autos

The sector I followed as a sell-side analyst for 11 years. Many hard lessons learned during that time, but the most important one was don't own stocks of domestic automakers when the U.S. auto sales cycle is past its peak. A corollary to that is don't own these names when interest rates are rising, and that is occurring as well. So, forget about the wow factor in the news flow about the race to autonomous vehicles (AVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with regards to General Motors (GM) , Ford (F) , and, yes, Tesla (TSLA) is actually a car company. Don't own the group here.

Tech

It is all about growth rates here, and reported earnings, which are really driven by profit margins, are not as important. Quick: What was Amazon's (AMZN) operating margin last quarter? I don't know off the top of my head, either. So, in looking at FAANG, you should separate the rapid growers -- Facebook (FB) , Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) -- from Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , which are more mature companies. If any of the ""FAN"" names miss on reported revenues, or more importantly revenue guidance, that stock will get hammered, a move that is frankly long overdue. So, watch earnings reports from the tech titans closely.

China

As mentioned in prior Real Money columns, I'm in Asia this month, and I certainly am not seeing any signs of an economic slowdown. I have been hoping for a trade war-induced meltdown in Chinese equities so I can add the chinese tech titans -- Alibaba (BABA) , Baidu (BIDU) , Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu-controlled iQiyi (IQ) -- to my clients' profiles for the long-term. Earnings are a more a reliable driver for freakouts than Ministry of Trade press releases, however, so I'll be watching numbers from the Chinese tech giants very closely this month, as well.",,
https://www.thestreet.com/technology/ibm-lands-1b-deal-with-australian-government-14641951,"Are you a large enterprise in the market for some AI, cybersecurity or blockchain services? IBM (IBM) would like your attention, please.

The computing giant landed a $740 million contract with the Australian government to power everything from hardware and cloud services to AI, quantum computing and blockchain research.

According to a press release, the sweeping deal is intended to bring ""more self-service, automation and digitization to Australia's government services,"" the government wrote. And it'll include joint programs in cybersecurity, enhancements to existing contracts with several agencies and the deployment of IBM research teams to further the use of AI, quantum computing and blockchain in government services.

It's good until 2023, and it's the highest-value contract ever negotiated by the Australian government, the release said.

""It shows trust and belief in our ability to transform and provide world-leading capabilities, leveraging our investments locally in AI, blockchain, quantum and cloud. We look forward to helping the Australian Government to re-define the digital experience,"" said David La Rose IBM's Managing Director of Australia & New Zealand in the release.

The deal follows a handful of recent, similar deals between IBM and various banks and large enterprises across the world. Some of those include: a $500 million, 10-year cloud computing contract with Italy's Banca Carige, a $320 million contract with Denmark's KMD to supply cloud and AI services, and a slew of agreements with companies like Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and Bausch & Lomb to move their workloads to IBM's cloud.

The 107-year-old computing firm is in the midst of a reinvention. It's now seeking to redefine itself as a cloud-first operator with the muscle to land big banking and government contracts. IBM says that its 'strategic imperatives' segment -- which includes cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- accounted for 47 percent of revenue last quarter. Cloud business alone accounted 22 percent of IBM's revenue in the first quarter of the year, signaling IBM's ongoing prioritization of cloud services, as well as newer offerings like its blockchain platform, Watson AI services for enterprises, cybersecurity and quantum computing.

IBM's strategic investments have yet to bear fruit for long-term shareholders. With many investors still seeing a company in turnaround mode, the stock has sagged about 9% since the beginning of 2018 and 17% over the past three years.

That could be changing, at least according to analysts like Nomura Instinet's Jeffrey Kvall, who wrote in a note to clients last week that IBM's vast resources and long history with many large enterprises worldwide could mean a competitive advantage as it looks to the future.

""Robust enterprise relationships, history in mission-critical applications, and strong professional services business make IBM singularly qualified to help enterprises adopt complex hybrid and multi-cloud networks,"" wrote Nomura Instinet's Jeffrey Kvaal in a June note to clients.

Saudi Arabia is reportedly ready to boost output, which means that the country would tap into its spare oil production capacity to ensure balance in the market.

Roku

Oppenheimer is feelin' bullish going into the holiday. Analysts boosted Roku Inc. (ROKU) to outperform from perform.

It also raised its price target to $50. As the market closed, Roku was trading around $45. It was up over 5%.

Over the past three months, Roku's soared over 41%.

TheStreet's Brian Sozzi spoke to Roku's CFO, Steve Louden, in May.

The streaming giant had just posted and beaten its first quarter earnings.

As crude oil's strong rebound continues -- I'm seeing WTI quoted at $73.31 as I write this -- I have been looking into different ways to play the jump in prices. My knee-jerk reaction is always to buy shares of small E&P companies, as those enterprises are generally levered to crude prices both through financial leverage and flat corporate structures that allow for profits to drop straight to the bottom line as opposed to being sucked away by layers of middle management as they might be at Exxon (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) . Don't get me wrong, XOM and CVX are also beneficiaries of this move in crude, and you would be crazy to sell them now if you own them.

The fact is, though, an extended period of sustainably higher oil prices changes the basic economics of drilling a well. Higher oil prices also increase the value of the land upon which E&P companies lease their drilling rights, as that land is worth the current discounted value of future production volumes. As the ""strip"" -- the NYMEX forward oil futures curve shifts -- upward, an E&P company's assets are worth more intrinsically. It's a pretty neat scenario from an economic perspective, and if you've forgotten the bull run of 2013-2014, you should take your ginkgo biloba pills, because it was a wild time.

The fact remains, however, that not every energy stock has rallied in this move, though most have, and the core ETF measuring E&P performance - XOP -- has risen ""only"" 15.4% thus far this year. That's obviously a nice move, but it has badly lagged the 22.9% gain in the generic front-month WTI futures contract -- CL.1. As someone who invests in these stocks professionally for my clients, I can attest to the fact that one has to be greedy during the up moves. To hold these stocks for any amount of time you have to be convinced the producers will outperform the commodity. That has not occurred in 2018.

So, sometimes, a different view of the same situation is warranted. What dragged me into the oil group in 2013 was a search for yield, and that led to the purchase of bonds and preferreds of E&P companies. Obviously I had to jettison many of those positions as the market wobbled after OPEC's disastrous Thanksgiving meeting in 2014 and through the ""oil bust"" of 2015 and early-2016.

The strong shall survive, though, and this week I have been buying fixed income securities of several of the companies I got to know before the bust, and that are still paying elevated yields. Again, higher commodity prices produce higher cash flows, and thus, to use an oil industry phrase, ""de-risk"" those securities. This week I have been buying:

CPE-A -- Callon Petroleum Co., 10.00% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock CPE-A)

79970YAD7 -- Sanchez Energy 6.125% Notes due 1/15/2023. Yes, bond CUSIPs are harder to remember than symbols like FB or AMZN, but getting a 16.3% yield makes it worth the effort. I spoke with CEO Tony Sanchez at the JP Morgan energy conference last week in NYC, and I am convinced the company will soon act on its long-flagged move to sell off non-core assets. That will allow Sanchez to focus all its capital on its Comanche and Catarina assets in the Eagle Ford. Due to its South Texas location, Sanchez's crude is priced based on the Louisiana Light Sweet benchmark, which has recently seen a premium of $10/barrel over crude pumped in the Permian and benchmarked to WTI.

Those are two long-term buy-and-holds that allow an investor to have exposure to leveraged oil producers without the agitation of stock market volatility.",,
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/06/28/2018/trump-helps-grease-skids-higher-oil-prices-these-2-names-should-benefit,"As Trump Helps Grease Skids for Higher Oil Prices, These 2 Names Should Benefit

There has been a lot of buzz in the oil markets recently as renewed efforts by the Trump administration to put economic pressure on Iran are putting bullish pressure on oil prices. Obviously a roadblock on Iranian oil exports would drive up demand for other sources, which likely would benefit U.S. oil demand and pricing in a pretty meaningful way.

However, the issue is not as simple as ""oil is up, U.S. energy stocks are up."" We need to take into account the long-term ability of the White House to keep that pressure on Iran, as well as the reactive moves by OPEC members not being sanctioned. If prices run high enough, players such as Saudi Arabia surely will take advantage of the ability to gain market share and improve margins.

The current story is based on economic trade pressure. The U.S. will impose sanctions on any importers of oil from Iran that don't cease the practice by November. For the broader market outside of energy stocks, this news will induce some seriously negative sentiment if it plays out. High oil prices likely would increase costs for a number of industries, putting negative pressure on profit margins.

Moreover, the move is going to increase trade tensions between the U.S. and its counterparts. Of course, this is assuming the U.S. actually succeeds in blocking others from importing Iranian oil. I think it would be very difficult for the United States to severe all trade ties with China or India if they were to refuse to stop buying Iranian oil. Then again, I never believed that President Trump would succeed in half of things he has done thus far, so I can't count it out.

Though Iranian oil has been the story, there are other underlying factors moving prices. While the news of tough love with Iran is certainly a driving factor of speculation, the latest inventory news is a big piece of the puzzle.

U.S. oil inventory levels fell by 9.9 million barrels the week of June 22. It was the biggest drawdown in inventories since 2016. I view this decline as the actual driving force behind West Texas Intermediate crude's 3% bump, as Brent crude, the main benchmark for international oil, including Iran's, only had gained 1.9% as of this writing. Also pushing prices higher is the production fallout in Canada. A power outage impacting production in Alberta, Canada, is expected to deprive the market of more than 300,000 barrels a day through part of July.

When you take all these events into consideration, you can see a global supply decrease has been in the works regardless of Iran, though the current pressure on Iran certainly isn't helping matters.

Short term, prices seem primed to stay high, even with Saudi Arabia reportedly planning record production levels in July. With nearly 11 million barrels a day, the country could pick up some market share, but it still doesn't sound like enough.

OPEC as a whole has agreed to increase production. Some have suggested that increase will mean an additional 700,000 to 1 million barrels a day, but that added output isn't a sure thing. Even if Russia boosts its output, OPEC collectively does not seem to be increasing production enough to counter a successful Iranian blockade. When you factor in the drama with Venezuela and Libya's inconsistent production, it seems likely that higher oil prices are going to last a little while.

Regarding stocks, the contention about sanctions is that it will put a damper on the market's mood overall. Costs will increase for manufacturers that need fuel to run their plants. Shipping companies such as FedEx Corp. (FDX) should be viewed with some caution, as higher fuel prices will affect their margins.

For oil companies, I think you'll see a nice boost in revenues in the coming quarters. I would caution that I'm bearish on refineries right now, as the higher oil prices will increase their costs to refine. That said, once gas prices catch up the difference should balance itself somewhat.

For investors, I think it's best to look at the established names. Obviously the tried and true never hurts.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is a great dividend play at 4%, and it is gaining more upside potential thanks in part to the price shift. The reason I would pick Exxon Mobil has a lot to do with the turnaround it has achieved over the past few years. With revenues bottoming in 2016, the oil giant has worked hard to reduce costs, boost operating income and increase earnings per share. Its March 31 results included a 17% increase in revenues year over year. From that $65.44 billion, Exxon delivered net income $4.65 billion, with a nearly 15% increase in diluted earnings per share of $1.09. Higher oil prices only will improve Exxon Mobil's already positive trend.

If you're more interested in trading oil itself, I like the United States Oil Fund ETF (USO) . I like it because it offers a way to trade oil prices without taking on the risk of leveraged funds. While leverage can be tempting to make big gains quick, it's an unnecessary risk that can get you into trouble fast. As the drama over Iran seems likely to escalate before it calms down, oil seems capable of pushing toward $80 a barrel. USO is a great instrument for trading the commodity.",,Exxon

The government instead plans to rely more heavily on the recently bolstered Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to stymie threats and concerns about foreign entities purchasing sensitive domestic technologies, said a senior official from the Trump administration.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended off 165, or 0.7%, at 24,118, the S&P 500 declined 0.86% and the Nasdaq fell 1.5% after trading higher earlier in the session.

""We considered a number of different mechanisms for addressing the concerns articulated regarding the acquisitions of sensitive technologies that may threaten U.S. national security, national interests,"" the Trump official was quoted as saying. ""In the end the president and his advisers settled on the idea that we have a strong and effective mechanism through the CFIUS process ... and that is a mechanism that can be used in the flexible and aggressive way to combat the practices that are troubling to the president.""

Tesla's Next Move Could Be a Pickup

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter Tuesday to ask his 22 million followers what they would like to see in a pickup truck produced by the electric vehicle maker.

What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances & what would be seriously next level? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 26, 2018

The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 26, 2018

The announcement comes days after Musk said that his fleet of electric semi trucks would feature a ""Mad Max"" mode that is expected to help the vehicle navigate lane turns in autopilot mode.

Supreme Court Sides With American Express in Antitrust Case

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor on American Express (AXP) Tuesday, saying that the company isn't barred from encouraging merchants it has contracts with from discouraging the use of rival cards by patrons.

The court's conservative majority ruled 5-4 in favor of the credit card company with Justice Clarence Thomas writing in the majority ruling that the special nature of credit card transactions is what protects the practice from antitrust laws.

""Amex's business model sometimes causes friction with merchants,"" he wrote. ""To maintain the loyalty of its cardholders, Amex must continually invest in its rewards program. But, to fund those investments, Amex must charge merchants higher fees than its rivals.""

""Even though Amex's investments benefit merchants by encouraging cardholders to spend more money, merchants would prefer not to pay the higher fees,"" Justice Thomas wrote. ""One way that merchants try to avoid them, while still enticing Amex's cardholders to shop at their stores, is by dissuading cardholders from using Amex at the point of sale.""

Uber's Future in London Hangs in the Balance Tuesday (Update)

Uber will be allowed to operate in London for the next 15 months after being awarded a license to operate after a court ruled in favor of its appeal against the Transport for London's decision to deny the company the license.

The regulator was dissatisfied with the ride-hailing company's operations in the city and declined to renew its license as a result.

Uber has more than 3.6 million regular users in London with a fleet of around 45,000 drivers.

Cities' Lawsuit Against Big Oil Over Climate Change Dismissed

A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco against BP (BP) , Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.B) , Exxon Mobil (XOM) , ConocoPhillips (COP) and Chevron (CVX) .

The lawsuit sought to force the companies to pay to protect cities' residents from the effects of climate change.

""The dangers raised in the complaints are very real,"" U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote. ""But those dangers are worldwide. Their causes are worldwide. The benefits of fossil fuels are worldwide. The problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case.""

Trump Attacks Harley-Davidson in Tuesday Tweet Storm

President Trump has been going on a tirade against motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson (HOG) for about 15 hours now following the company's decision to move some of its operations overseas to combat tariffs from the EU.

The 'Make America Great Again' President showed his displeasure with the move through a series of tweets Monday night and Tuesday morning.

Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

But he wasn't done.

Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018

....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018

....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won't take very long! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018

Harley's shares are all but guaranteed to take a hit following Tuesday's barrage.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/federal-judge-dismisses-global-warming-suit-14634424,"A federal judge on Monday, June 25, dismissed a suit in which the cities of Oakland and San Francisco sued the world's five largest investor-owned fossil fuel-producing companies for the consequences of global warming caused by the use of fossil fuels.

""The dangers raised in the complaint are very real,"" U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup, a Clinton appointee, wrote at the end of his 16-page opinion. ""But those dangers are worldwide. Their causes are worldwide. The benefits of fossil fuels are worldwide. The problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case.""

Alsup, a Clinton appointee, also cited a more legalistic reason for his decision to rule in favor of BP plc (BP) , Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Conoco Phillips (COP) , Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A) , the defendants in the case. Under Supreme Court precedent, he held, the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to set emissions standards under the Clean Air Act bars federal common law nuisance claims like the one that the two California cities brought.

Oakland and San Francisco argued that they will eventually be submerged as water levels rise thanks to global warming. While the judge credited the science behind that assertion, he called the scope of the complaint ""breathtaking,"" since it would incorporate the worldwide sale of fossil fuels by a seller who knew of their contribution to global warming.

While legal precedent allowed Alsup to dismiss the case, he also acknowledged the moral quandary posed by the suit. ""Our industrial revolution and the development of our modern world has literally been fueled by oil and coal. All of us have benefitted. Would it really be fair to now ignore our own responsibility in the use of fossil fuels and place the blame for global warming on those who supplied what we demanded? Is it really fair, in light of those benefits, to say that the sale of fossil fuels was unreasonable?""

The dismissed lawsuit came at a time when a large percentage of institutional investors including some big index funds are backing shareholder proposals seeking to push Exxon and other big energy companies to limit the use of fossil fuels and address their impact on business.

Climate change and investors' concerns led shareholder majorities in 2017 to approve proposals urging Exxon Mobile Corp. (XOM) , Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) and PPL Corp. (PPL) to produce reports on the impact of climate risks on their long-term strategy in a significant success for investors seeking to push companies to think about environmental issues.

The proposals were nonbinding, which means the energy giants are under no obligation to implement any changes in response to shareholder support. However, Exxon said last December that it would improve its disclosures on how climate change could affect its business after the shareholder vote for the measure topped 60%.

""The board has decided to further enhance the company's disclosures consistent with the proposal and will seek to issue these disclosures in the near future,"" Exxon said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""These enhancements will include energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.""

Exxon did not provide a specific date for when it will issue the disclosures its decision was thought likely Exxon's move could the strong backing could embarrass them into producing a detailed report or taking other actions.

President Donald Trump announced in June that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris accord. Despite the move, measures focusing on climate change did well in 2017 -- similar shareholder proposals focusing on the 2 degrees Celsius level at ten other companies received between 35% and 50% of the vote, a huge vote of support.

The New York State Common Retirement Fund submitted the proposal for the 2017 shareholder meeting and received support from significant institutional investors, such as BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , State Street Corp. (STT) and Vanguard, according to CNBC. They were Exxon's top three investors in 2017.

Notable as well, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said in a letter to investors and businesses earlier this year that, expects climate risk-related firms like the big oil producers to, ""have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business"" and how a given company will address it.",2018-06-26,

The Trade: Buy 1 XOM September 85 call and sell 1 XOM September 90 call for a $0.80 debit. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM now sports a market cap of over $340 billion. Over the past 52 trading weeks, it has had a stock price low of $72 and a high $89 (both rounded). And XOM trades with a trailing PE of 17x but a forward PE of just 15x. XOM analysts think that the company will show a year-over-year 17% increase in sales growth when it reports its second-quarter earnings near the end of July. In addition, the company should show a 14% increase year-over-year in revenue in third-quarter results. These two earnings reports should show headline-grabbing earnings per share increases near 50%. XOM's annual dividend yield is 4%. As earnings increase, XOM does at times raise its dividend. And that is exactly what XOM did last month, raising the quarterly dividend by $0.05 a share. Technically, XOM has formed into my washout pattern. Thus, the proverbial last long might have already bailed only a few days ago, as the shorts completed their exposure to XOM. If so, not much resistance might be left to keep XOM from making an upside move over the summer months. The trade tactic I prefer now for XOM is the bullishly biased, out-of-the-money, vertical call spread expiring in September. The trade is as follows: Buy 1 XOM September 85 call and sell 1 XOM September 90 call for a $0.80 debit.

Jim Cramer: There's Plenty Going Up Away From FAAANG

""FAANG, or FAAANG (add Apple (AAPL) and Adobe (ADBE) to the A of Amazon (AMZN) ), is abhorrent to most money managers who opine on stocks "" says TheStreet's Jim Cramer.

""The rap is a simple one: you can't have these stocks lead the market. It's absurd and they have too much market cap when compared to the market capitalization of whole countries. Now I admit it does feel strained to have such a limited number of stocks going higher. But this time I do beg to differ,"" Cramer writes.

Technical Indicators Hold the Keys to Successful Market Navigation

Real Money Pro columnist Robert Lang notes that ""The stock market has been challenging and difficult to navigate of late. A story here, a tweet there can shift any gained momentum into reverse. The drops and pops are often disguised as misdirection, and just when we think there is some potential follow-through on a big day, all of a sudden the markets lose it. It's maddening!""

""Let me tell you,"" Lang continues, ""while technical analysis is not a silver bullet, it certainly provides strong clues and evidence to help one wade through the waters and not get bit by an unseen shark. However, it does take some good understanding, constant learning (repetition), belief in behavioral patterns and identification. But if you're willing to learn, you just might give yourself a chance to stay in the game.""

Three Super Momentum Stocks and How to Play Them

""One of the most common mistakes that traders make is underestimating the power of momentum. Strong stocks tend to go much higher than we tend to think is reasonable. We figure this stock has gone up almost 300% in a month, so it is reasonable for it to pull back and rest. Rather than chase it we should just wait for a better entry,"" according to Real Money columnist James DePorre.

""I've discussed three such super momentum stocks quite a bit recently. The one thing they all have in common is that they are recent China-based IPOs. iQIYI (IQ) is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of China. Both HUYA (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) are involved in online gaming,"" says DePorre.

Boosted by President Trump's low corporate taxes, a restricted or reversed regulatory environment and lax enforcement, corporate America is in a sweet spot that should be supportive of growing equity prices. The fact that markets are stuck in a range that's not quite 10% below their peaks in January may signal that investors are concerned that the Trump trade is closer to its end than its beginning.

A clue to that comes from an interview that TheStreet's executive editor Brian Sozzi conducted with Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari that can be seen elsewhere on our site. Sozzi notes that Kashkari is concerned about new regulations that ease business conditions on the banking industry, restrictions that were put in place after the financial debacle of 2007.

Kashkari told Sozzi he fears investors have forgotten the lessons learned in that era:

""It has only been 10 years and we are already forgetting how devastating the financial crisis was, we are already convincing ourselves that everything is fine again and we can relax some of the rules and we will be fine in the future. The fact is we are going to repeat the same mistakes again, it's a question of when not if.""

Until that happens, the best bet in the markets would probably be some combination of bread and circuses, if only to avert the gaze from the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Might as well watch some more TV.

To that end, investors have embraced Netflix (NFLX) , which just signed Barack and Michelle Obama to produce some content and passed Disney (DIS) as the most valuable media company. Another good bet along those lines is Alphabet (GOOGL) , which is set to leverage its near-monopoly position in search and search advertising to get even richer than it already is - and at a price/earnings ratio that's a lot lower than Netflix.

Anyway, gasoline prices aren't rising this weekend as fast as many people thought, so it's a good time to strap the dog on top of the car and head to the beach or the mountains. Whatever - drive safely.

Weekly U.S. jobless claims rose 11,000 to 234,000, a seven-week high.

Wall Street Overview

Stocks fell Thursday, May 24, after Donald Trump called off a summit meeting planned for next month with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.

In a letter released by the White House, Trump said: ""I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.""

Nuclear-armed North Korea recently said it could cancel the summit if the U.S. attempted to force it to give up its nuclear arsenal unilaterally.

Sentiment already had been dented Thursday by a possible move from the Trump administration to impose new tariffs on automobile imports.

Trump said he would launch a national security investigation into car and truck imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the same pretext he used to slap 25% tariffs on non-American steel and aluminium earlier this year. The move, which followed his hint that a ""different structure"" may be needed to arrange a new trade relationship with China, added to concerns that inward-looking trade polices will slow economic growth into the second half of the year.

Shares of auto export giants Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) , Honda Motor Co. (HMC) and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY) fell Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 75 points, or 0.30%, to 24,811. The S&P 500 declined 0.20% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.02%. Leading the Dow lower were Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) .

Best Buy Co. ( BBY ) posted first-quarter adjusted profit of 82 cents a share, ahead of Wall Street estimates of 74 cents. Revenue of $9.11 billion beat estimates, and same-store sales jumped 7.1%, ahead of consensus that called for an increase of 2.5%. The stock fell 6.6%.

Medtronic PLC (MDT) posted fourth-quarter adjusted profit of $1.42 a share, 3 cents ahead of estimates. Revenue in the quarter rose 2.9% to $8.14 billion and topped forecasts. Shares rose 1.9%.

Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) earned 44 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter, 1 cent below estimates. Revenue was $2.33 billion, also below forecasts of $2.39 billion. The stock fell 1%.

Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) said Thursday it would slash thousands of jobs as it reshapes its operations and looks to cut costs.

About 56% of large-cap mutual funds have outperformed the broader market year to date, putting the group on track to tally its best year since 2007, according to portfolio strategy research analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Source: Goldman Sachs

Overweight industries within outperforming sectors, including information technology, consumer discretionary and energy, have supported strong mutual fund returns this year, Goldman said. ""The highest conviction stock positions and a favorable macro landscape have also boosted outperformance,"" analysts added.

With their strong performance so far in a year marked with relative uncertainty, mutual funds seemed to have the right stock-picking sense. Funds shifted their directional view to rate the energy sector overweight for the first time since at least 2012 in the first quarter of this year, Goldman found.

In addition to renewed bullishness on energy, large-cap mutual funds most increased their allocation in the first quarter to consumer staples, up 32bps, and to financials, up 31bps.

Information technology remained overweight among the big mutual funds, but the funds have recently reduced their relative allocation to the sector to the lowest level since at least 2012, according to Goldman. Despite that decline, funds remain overweight tech by 65bps, second only to financials overweight 138bps.

Goldman analysts' basket of mutual fund overweight-rated names has outperformed underweights by 550bps and the S&P 500 by 250bps since the start of the year, Goldman noted. Constituents with the largest overweight in Goldman's fund basket are Visa Inc. (V) , Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) , Citigroup Inc. (C) , Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) . Constituents with the largest underweight are Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) , Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Intel Corp. (INTC) and AT&T Inc. (T) .

Mutual funds' strong 2018 performance followed what was a fruitful 2017 for many large-cap funds. According to Goldman, performance has paid off. Large-cap funds that beat their benchmarks by more than 100bps in 2017 saw inflows of $10 million or more in the first quarter of 2018, far and away topping the $3 million of outflows for the median fund during the same time.

The best performing mutual funds were most overweight tech and increased their allocation to both tech and energy sectors in the first quarter of 2018. By contrast, funds that experienced outflows on average hold tech at index weight.",2018-05-24,Goldman Sachs
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/did-trump-just-torpedo-the-market-again-14598790,"Beware of incoming torpedoes, traders.

President Trump is back to rattling the markets again with his comments. Trump said Tuesday he wasn't pleased with last week's trade talks with China and cast doubt on the status of a June 12 meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked 178 points on Tuesday following Trump's comments. Markets on Wednesday look equally shaky. Europe's oil and gas sector was nailed 2.5%, the worst slide since February on a closing basis, according to Bloomberg data, at the hands of falling crude oil prices. Major markets in Europe and Asia were firmly in the red. Dow futures were down more than 170 points as of 6:32 a.m. ET.

Curious on why stocks are so quick to sell off on yet another verbal bombing from Trump? It's simple: Wall Street remains incredibly bullish on the market and by extension so do their clients across the globe.

Take for example these comments from Goldman Sachs this week, where you can just sense the optimism with each passing sentence:

""We forecast strong earnings and dividend growth will help the S&P 500 rise by 5% to our year-end target of 2850 assuming no change in valuation. We expect dividends will rise by 10% to $54. We noted in January that the dividend swap market's pricing of 8% 2018 DPS growth did not reflect the steeper trajectory for S&P 500 earnings following the passage of corporate tax reform. Today, the 2018 dividend swap contract trades in line with our top-down estimate of $54 (+10%). Exceptional 1Q results give investors reason for optimism. S&P 500 EPS grew by 24% year/year in 1Q, supported by 11% sales growth and 108 bpof margin expansion. Pretax earnings rose by an impressive 13%, suggesting fundamentals are strong even without the accretive effects of lower corporate tax rates. DPS grew by 9% year/year. For the first time since S&P began collecting the data in 2003, no company cut its dividend during the first four months of the year. In fact, 181 S&P 500 companies have raised their common dividends by a median of 10%. The largest weighted increases were by Apple (AAPL) (+16%), AbbVie (ABBV) (+35%), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) (+6%). Dividend raises both increase the yield to equity investors and the intrinsic value of an equity when valuing the market with a DDM.""

With that degree of optimism around dividend and earnings growth, no wonder the market is quick to sell off on Trump comments. Investors are ill-prepared for the return of volatility and will sell first and ask questions later.

Said TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer over on Real Money: ""So stick with individual stocks. Do not be afraid to cut your losses and recognize that when the charts break, there's no rallying until the sellers stop selling and the buy cycle begins anew.""

Welcome to Silicon Valley

I touched down in San Francisco Tuesday afternoon for a week of meetings and typing from a cozy Hampton Inn 0.7 miles from the airport. How you know you aren't in New York anymore and tech valuations are hovering around record highs? You turn on the radio and there is a commercial for Amazon (AMZN) (which is an Action Alerts PLUS holding) cloud services and a Starbucks coffee costs $1 more than in already pricey New York. One company I am here to talk with is Action Alerts PLUS holding PayPal.

PayPal (PYPL) shares have traded sideways over the last five sessions as Wall Street awaits the fintech giant's key investor day on Thursday. TheStreet will be at PayPal's San Francisco headquarters covering the event, so be sure to check in with yours truly @Briansozzi on Twitter. Wall Street is keen to hear more about PayPal's transition deal with eBay (EBAY) announced several months ago. ""CFO's goal for the investor meeting will be to address concerns around the eBay transition,"" says JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang. ""Recognizing proof points will take time, investors should take some comfort recognizing that PayPal successfully navigated other transitions including customer choice and an asset light deal with Synchrony.""

Long-time tech analyst Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets also expects a deep discussion on how PayPal will monetize the popular money sharing app Venmo and deploy even more of its cash (the market wants more deals from PayPal, especially in light of the well-received iZettle deal).

What's Hot

(1) Micron (MU) has suddenly become one of the hottest stocks in the market after its investor day on Monday, up 11% on the week. Credit goes to Micron execs for taking the wraps off a monstrous $10 billion stock buyback. TheStreet looked at the numbers, and Micron's stock could explode to more than $100 a share off the buyback (current price: $59). Here's how it could happen.

(2) According to new data from CB Insights, venture capital (VC for you cool kids) investment in private and emerging companies in the U.S. tallied $22.1 billion in the first quarter, up 21% sequentially and up 49% annually.

The Fortune 500, now in its 64th year, is an annual list of the largest corporations in the U.S. ranked by revenue for fiscal 2017. The companies making up the list for fiscal 2017 represented a significant two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product with $12.8 trillion in revenue, $1 trillion in profits and $21.6 trillion in market value. The 500 firms employed 28.2 million people globally.

Walmart again topped the list, marking its sixth-straight year in the No. 1 spot. In 2017, Walmart became the first company in history to generate $500 billion in annual sales.

Coming in second was Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , surpassing in rank both Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) . Only three companies have ever topped the Fortune 500 list since its inception in 1955: Exxon Mobil, Walmart and General Motors Co. (GM) . There are 53 companies that have made the list every year for the past 64, including Exxon, GM, Chevron Corp. (CVX) and General Electric Co. (GE) . General Electric fell five spots in 2017 to No. 18, its lowest rank ever.

Apple dipped one spot to fourth place from third, despite a 6% gain in annual sales. The company remains the most valuable on the Fortune 500 list, though, with an $851 billion market cap at year-end. Apple also led the ranking in profit for the fourth consecutive year, earning $48 billion in 2017.

For the first time ever, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) eked into the top 10, earning the No. 8 ranking. At the same time, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) was the biggest mover - the electric car company jumped 123 spots to rank No. 260 in 2017.

On average, companies in the Fortune 500 returned 18% to shareholders throughout 2017, putting the ranking just below the broader S&P 500's 21% gain for the period. Netflix Inc. (NFLX) led all Fortune 500 companies in annual 10-year return to shareholders through 2017, while Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) led in annual five-year return.

Utilities, insurance companies and banks led all industries on the Fortune 500. The total number of financial companies ballooned to 88 from 84, snagging about $228 billion in profits as a group last year. With Apple in the lead, five of the six most-valuable companies on the list last year were technology companies. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the only non-tech exception in the top five.

There were 24 female chief executives of Fortune 500 companies in 2017, down from 32 a year earlier.

Prior to Friday, crude prices had been climbing as traders harbored concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East and Venezuela that could tighten the global oil market.

The U.S. earlier this month pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, renewing sanctions on the country, which the third largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Sanctions on Iran could limit its ability to export crude oil, leading to further supply shortages.

Simultaneously, fellow OPEC member country Venezuela has continued to undergo extreme economic collapse, putting the country's crude supply in jeopardy.

Given the potential supply disruptions, there is a ""real possibility"" of oil reaching $100 per barrel, according to Jefferies energy analyst Jason Gammel.

""It is really going to be primarily dependent on whether all of the supply risks that appear to be emerging all come together at the same time,"" Gammel told Bloomberg.

Last night, news broke, or we kind of thought it did. Emails and reports came in from scattered sources. Beijing had apparently proposed cutting China's trade surplus with the United States by $200 billion. The proposed package was to include some trade concessions, lowered tariffs on U.S. goods coupled with the increased import of such products. Boeing (BA) specifically was named as a potential beneficiary.

Within a few hours, these reports would be denied. No dice? Maybe. This all seems to be very murky. One related news story that appeared to be true was that as the U.S. and Chinese delegations tried to work on a deal, that China had dropped its anti-dumping probe into U.S. sorghum shipments. A positive, I think.

At the same time, President Donald Trump responded to increasingly harsh rhetoric from Pyongyang with some tough talk of his own, as the meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for June 12 in Singapore hangs in the balance. That came after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer simply stated ""The NAFTA countries are nowhere close to a deal"" the very same day that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had implied that there was already a good deal on the table.

Headlines, both real and imagined. That's the 24-hour news cycle.

You, my friends, still trying to navigate your portfolios around all of that noise -- plus the current state of monetary and fiscal policies that have produced a stronger dollar on heightened expectations for rising interest rates -- while the market tries to successfully wind down what has been not just an excellent earnings season, but one ""seasoned"" with mostly optimistic guidance.

Smart Investing

I speak to you often on discipline. I wrote in Thursday's column on how, while I do not expect markets to crash in our immediate front, that when that next haymaker lands on your face, it will likely come from a place of perceived safety, taking many by surprise due to the complexity of modern systems.

Part of playing defense is staying diversified to a degree that complements one's one tolerance for risk. This not only means spreading the wealth across sectors, but across asset classes. In times of crisis, hard assets might just hedge one's portfolio against both equity and debt instruments. Might. There are no sure things in our sport.

One thing not covered by my personal set of rules that I do occasionally lay out for those who ask, is the lining of my overall book with certain stocks that provide dividend income. Now, I am a trader, not someone who is very likely to ""set it and forget it."" What that means is that I already have a designated bond portfolio, I don't need to load my book with Utilities and REITs just to check a box. I want dividend payers competing in businesses that I am interested in and believe in.

These are several names that I am indeed long, and hold their place on my book for possibly several reasons, one of which is that they pay me to own the shares. Hard not to like someone who says ""thank you."" That's what a dividend is. A monetary acknowledgement of your equity stake.

Four Dividend Longs

I'm actually long these stocks myself. Do a lot of guys give you that?

1) Seagate Technology (STX) . Last sale: $59.02, Dividend yield: 4.26%. This firm is one of the three major manufacturers of hard drives. The stock had tended to trade very cyclically, ramping significantly higher earlier this year when the firm revealed that it had invested in the blockchain cryptocurrency known as ""Ripple.""

The market value of Ripple has fluctuated far more as 2018 has progressed than has the market value of STX. The impressive thing about Seagate has been the company's commitment to its dividend, even when the stocks runs cold, and the yield soars to seemingly ridiculous levels.

I have been long STX long-term. The company has consistently increased returns to shareholders over that time.

2) Exxon Mobil (XOM) . Last sale: $81.88, Dividend yield: 4.01%. Folks looked at me sideways when I got into this one. No longer. Not only has the stock finally started to perform nicely, the month of May has been very kind to market prices for crude, as for the broader energy sector.

This is a somewhat new position for me (meaning that it was a 2018 purchase), and the name's underperformance was as much a reason for this investment as was the payout. You can substitute any number of ""Big Oil"" names here.

Be cognizant that some of my respected colleagues prefer Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) , which has admittedly been a better market performer this year.

3) Altria Group (MO) . Last Sale: $55.29, Dividend yield: 5.06%. This stock was simply crushed in response to earnings in late April. Earnings looked fine, though shipments were lower. That is when I got myself involved. Altria has traded sideways since.

This for me, is a pure dividend play. I am concerned about the future of tobacco, though. Because it kills people? No. I have chewed tobacco for nearly my entire adult life, and have smoked when necessary just to keep the bugs out of my face when forced to spend time in less-than-hospitable environments. Cannabis. The spreading legitimization of the cannabis trade will likely threaten life as we know it for big tobacco and for booze... or maybe that's the natural evolution of this business? In the meantime, get paid.

4) Procter & Gamble (PG) . Last sale: $73.96, Dividend yield: 3.86%. How interesting is this long? P&G was severely beaten in response to earnings-related guidance that ended up drawing downgrades from multiple analysts. It got to point where I was forced to pull the trigger in early May. Did I time the bottom? I guess so, if the world ends today.

Consumer packaged goods are trading in the hole. P&G is brand strong, and trades at a more than a fair valuation. On top of that, since December, the company has Trian Fund Management's Nelson Peltz on the board. Is he perfect? Heck, I don't even know the guy. However, I do know that he will pressure management into increased value creation.

What Really Happened Here

Headline risks persist. However, for the S&P 500, there really are several key levels in play right now that also matter. Observe the following:

The ""giant pennant"", or converging triangle (orange lines) closed earlier this month. Typically, that causes a violent move, but does not determine direction. The breakout did come at that point and you now know that the breakout was northerly. That move came to screeching halt at 2743. Why is that significant?

The 2743 level just happens to be a 61.8% re-tracement of the move that begins with the January high through the February low. The central trend line of a Pitchfork model that begins with the April lows also ran through that spot at that time. A twice-enforced point of resistance. No wonder the market came in at that time. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) now stands at 2678. The 2712 level has acted as the low sale for the index for two days running.

What does that mean? As support has been found at approximately halfway between perceived resistance, and prior perceived support.

I view this as confirmation of the uptrend momentum that we have recently seen, and would consider that to be short-term bullish. Just a kid with an opinion. Sarge out.

Ford Motor Co. (F) is preparing for a scaled deployment of its Autonomous Vehicle program in 2021 but as the business is not making money currently, the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker's current cost-cutting plans may not be enough to earn Ford a higher earnings multiple, according to Piper Jaffray & Co.

Ford has been trimming its product portfolio and doubling down on its most profitable segments. The company is also committed to delivering improvements in China and other underperforming global markets, Piper Jaffray analysts noted.

""We appreciate the focus on 'fitness,' as well as Ford's newfound willingness to cull less profitable platform,"" Piper Jaffray analysts Alexander Potter and Winnie Dong wrote in a May 15 research note.

""But with U.S. vehicle sales slowly eroding, we think investors are looking for more fundamental changes from Ford - and from automotive companies in general,"" Potter and Dong wrote. ""Ford may yet capture its share of the $1 trillion market for autonomous rides, but in our view, the company isn't a leader in this market -- at least not yet.""

Given the lack of bullish catalysts, the firm downgraded Ford to Neutral and cut its price target to $12. Shares of Ford rose 0.8% to $11.31 at 12 p.m. New York time.

The U.S. automaker with a market capitalization of $44.9 billion plans to deploy its autonomous vehicles on a city-by-city basis in three years. While the company's intimate understanding and experience in fleet production provides advantages in the autonomous vehicle segment, Ford's other priorities, such as building up its pipeline of trucks and SUVs, may slow its AV efforts.

""Ford's pragmatism might pay off -- but only if auto market disruption advances slowly,"" Potter and Dong wrote.

Ford is in a race with General Motors Co. (GM) , Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Waymo, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) , Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and others to produce autonomous vehicles, but it's proving to be a costly venture.

""I think we showed in our financial results in the first quarter, we lost $102 million for a recall for [the mobility] segment, and that's where we are now,"" Chris Brewer, chief program engineer for Ford's autonomous vehicle development, said on Tuesday at the Evercore ISI Global Auto Conference. ""As we move forward and closer to 2021, we'll expect to continue to spend at that rate or more so. But the goal is to start to show return as soon as we can, ideally the '21 timeframe.""

One of the challenges is with the battery technology, Brewer said, as current battery packs aren't big enough to run a car all day. Ford is engineering its autonomous vehicles to last hundreds of thousands of miles, hence the need for an long-lasting battery.

""For us to recover the investment we put into it, including the variable cost of the vehicle, we want to have it run as many miles as possible so that us and our partners benefit from it,"" Brewer explained.

Separately, activist Paul Singer's Elliott Management on Tuesday reported acquiring new significant positions in Ford, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and other companies.

According to the firm's first-quarter 2018 13F securities filing, which is based on positions the fund held as of March 30, Elliott bought $17 million in Ford, or 1.5 million shares. The new positions suggest that some of these companies could become targets for the activist fund down the road, according to TheStreet's Ron Orol.

http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/05/11/2018/how-play-oils-big-rebound,"How to Play Oil's Big Rebound

Oil has been on a constant march higher since bottoming out last June. With summer-driving season around the corner, the price has to head even higher from here, right? Not necessarily.

In fact, that hasn't been the case over the last few years. Rather, West Texas Intermediate crude has headed lower beginning in June every year since 2014. You might even recall that 2014 was particularly brutal for oil, which lost more than half of its value during the year's second half.

So, I'm approaching oil-company stocks with caution here. In addition to the concerns noted above, we have to worry about the U.S. dollar. What impact will it have on the bottom line? Revenue is great, but what a company can use it for or keep is more important.

Let's check out some individual oil sectors and names:

International Oil Majors

While you're probably alright putting your money in a large U.S. oil name like ExxonMobil (XOM) given its 4% dividend yield, XOM's long-running underperformance vs. the S&P 500 worries me a bit. After all, the market hasn't yet experienced much rotation into underperformers. Winners continue to get all of the attention while losers stay in the time-out corner

Add in my concerns about the dollar and rising domestic interest rates and I'm warming up more toward some U.S.-listed foreign oil names like Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) , France's Total (TOT) , Italy's Eni (E) and Norway's Statoil (STO) . I might even give China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (SNP) some consideration here.

The only major problem here involves dividends. ExxonMobil offers a solid dividend yield with little risk of that coming down. By contrast, Royal Dutch Shell currently boasts a better dividend yield -- 5% -- but a high payout ratio, which measures how much net income a firm must use to cover its dividend payments. A high payout ratio is risky, as RDS.A could have to cut its distribution if there's ever any hiccup in its business.

So, Total might represent the best mix here. It combines a generous 4.65% dividend yield and a payout ratio that's higher than Exxon Mobil's but lower than Royal Dutch Shell's. And Eni registers as the safest of the bunch, with a payout ratio that's half of XOM's despite a nice 3.25% dividend yield.

China Petroleum also often offers the highest distribution, but it's a bit of a guessing game whether SNP will pay a 6%+ yield or something under 4%. SNP's payout ratio was 118% last year, and the anticipated May 24th dividend sits at $4.57. But what we've seen from China Petroleum in the past and what we get in the present are often two very different things.

That said, SNP often follows its May payout with a September dividend. So if you're a yield player with a bend toward slightly more aggressive oil exposure, China Petroleum might be for you.

But personally, I prefer investing in a mix of Royal Dutch Shell, Total, SNP and Eni. That offers an anticipated net yield greater than XOM at a similar payout ratio, but with the benefit of investment diversity.

Forget the Oil Refiners

Refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX) , Valero Energy (VLO) , and HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC) are already so extended that they've become an impossible chase. We're talking +15-20% year to date and up 50% from this time last year.

I'd rather dive into a master limited partnership like Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) . ETE's yield is pushing toward 7.5%, and we already have earnings out of the way. And from a performance standpoint, MLPs have done little year to date, so they offer a reinvest-yield thesis while prices are depressed.

Skip Most Explorers, Too

It's a similar story with oil explorers -- Whiting (WLL) , Petrobras (PBR) , and Transocean (RIG) have already snagged all of the momentum.

I'd rather lean toward Diamond Offshore Drilling DO, which is one of the few names sitting at resistance right now rather than having broken well above it. I suspect we'll see that break through eventually.

That being said, RIG doesn't look too far extended. I'd either buy DO on a breakout or wait for the group to pull back.

However, I expect this group to get hit the hardest If oil lags in June. With nothing in the way of yield, it's all about capital appreciation -- and oil prices -- here. Unfortunately, I simply don't have enough confidence to buy.

So, a name like Baker Hughes General Electric (BHGE) is where I'd turn. BHGE's 2% dividend yield won't turn heads, but the company combines little debt with a price-to-earnings ratio similar to better-known oil names like Schlumberger (SLB) or Halliburton (HAL) . And if National Oilwell Varco (NOV) ever ups its distribution, I'd turn more attention its way as well.

The Bottom Line

If you haven't jumped on the oil bandwagon yet, you're late to the party -- very late.

I'd enter any stock cautiously here -- not committing to a full position, but maybe just a one-quarter position to start. Then, watch for retests of previous breakout levels or an oil retracement in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% before getting to a larger position.",,Exxon
http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/05/10/2018/jim-cramer-stock-market-knows-not-necessarily-trust-oil-futures,"Jim Cramer: The Stock Market Knows Not Necessarily to Trust the Oil Futures

Why isn't the market more fearful of an oil spike here? Why are we comfortable, if not bullish, when oil runs as it did yesterday and the early morning today over Middle Eastern tensions?

First, I don't think the market is ignoring oil. When missiles fly back and forth between the Iranians in Syria and the Israelis over the somewhat peaceful Golan Heights area, it should be unnerving. If there is going to be a hot war besides the one between the Saudis and Yemen, it could be between the Israelis and the Iranians, with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia - strange bedfellows, actually pulling for and outright helping Israel.

But I think that the stock market knows not necessarily to trust the oil futures. Stock traders know that oil traders are a skittish bunch and take oil up on any and all tensions. They seem to know only one thing: take oil up on bad news and the equities people have become suspicious of big runs, especially ones driven by geopolitical risk and not demand.

I think that's because we all remember the ridiculous spike in oil back in 2008 that ended up in a total collapse of the market. It's worth it to recall what happened back then because it is instructive about why stock players have one eye on the oil market but not both.

With the world's economy, particularly China, in growth mode in 2008, even as our economy had begun to fall apart, we knew there was overseas demand for oil.

The oil market had been in a trading range between $40 and $60 for several years coming in to 2008. Then beginning in February, the political problems in Venezuela, a key OPEC country, began to surface as they cut off oil sales to Exxon Mobil (XOM) . Venezuela's problems coincided with a break out of the $40 to $60 range into the $80s.

Then in March two major pipelines from Iraq were taken out by terrorists. Oil suddenly jumped to the nineties.

In April, a Nigeria workers strike cut Exxon's production, taking 780,000 barrels a day off line. At the same time a strike by Scottish workers took out half of the UK's production.

In May, Nigerian rebels blew up pipelines that took out another 600,000 barrels a day at the same time that Mexico announced some shortfalls at its biggest field in the Gulf of Mexico.

Next thing you know oil's breaking out above $100 and flirting with $120.

Then on June 19th and 20th, Nigerian rebels shut down the Shell (RDS.A) and Chevron (CVX) pipes and oil blasts through $120, and finally in the first week of July, on no real news, oil takes out $140 and touches $147.

What happened after that is indicative about how fragile, skittish and, at times manipulated because the market simply collapsed pretty much in a straight line, all the way down to $31 on December 22 of the same year, a spectacular $110 swan dive.

Gasoline, which had gone to an average of $4.11 a gallon was cut in half by year's end.

Now, given the fact that the whole way up and the whole way down we were headed into the depths of the Great Recession, the whole pivot to $147 seems like it was pure manipulation. But it is fair to say that higher prices simply met with little selling the whole way up. It's almost as if there is no spare capacity to sell, but that turned out to not be the case. It just couldn't be ramped up fast enough.

And that's what I think is happening now. The oil market is terribly inefficient and supply seems to be provided only by the short sellers, who then cover when no new oil comes to the market. There's not enough time to find real sellers or they are all holding out for higher prices.

Whatever, the equity buyers know not to trust the spikes. They learned that in 2008. And how about the damage to the economy? I think that it wasn't clear how much damage it did then but one thing is clear, cars get a lot more gas mileage today than they did back them. As Phil Labeau told me today on ""Squawk on the Street"", $5 is the new $4 and we are nowhere near $5.

So, sure, oil's gotten up there. But we know the futures aren't necessarily real and that's keeping the stock market from drawing a conclusion that stocks must be sold en masse because of oil's sudden jump to the $70s or even beyond.",,

1. -- Stocks Narrowly Rise as Trump Welcomes North Korean Prisoners

U.S. stock futures were slightly higher Thursday, May 10, as Wall Street watched President Donald Trump welcome three Americans held hostage in North Korean back onto U.S. soil ahead of a groundbreaking summit between the president and North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.07%, those linked to the broader S&P 500 gained 0.17% and Nasdaq Composite futures climbed 0.21%.

President Trump met with the three hostages, Kim Hak-song, Kim Sang-duk and Kim Dong-chul, after their release was brokered by new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a visit to Pyongyang this week. Kim Dong-chul, a 60-year old pastor, was arrested in 2015 and charged with 10 years' hard labor for spying. The other two men, both teachers at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, were arrested last year on suspicion of ""hostile activities"" toward the regime.

""These are three great people,"" the President said on the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base greeting the men and Pompeo. ""Frankly we didn't think it was going to happen and it did and we're proud of this achievement, but the real victory will be when we are able to denuclearize the entire [Korean] peninsula. I think he [Kim Jong-un] did this because he really wants to do something ... to bring his country into the real world.""

The U.S. economic calendar on Thursday includes core consumer pricing. Analysts expect a core CPI increase of 0.2%, in line with last month. Amid signs of growing inflation at packaged good companies like Tyson Foods (TSN) , the CPI will be more closely watched than the norm. Also on Thursday, Wall Street will watch for the federal budget expected at 2:00 p.m. ET.

Earnings reports are expected Thursday from Action Alerts PLUS holding Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and fresh-to-the-market Dropbox Inc. (DBX) , which will report after the market close.

Roku's (ROKU) Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden struck a very bullish tone with TheStreet's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi after earnings Wednesday evening.

2. -- Energy Stocks Lead Market Charge Despite Unrest in Gulf

Energy stocks continued to rally in early Thursday trading, sustaining momentum from earlier in the week.

The rally comes on the heels of President Trump's decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal, which had eased sanctions on Iran in return for the country agreeing to scale back its nuclear program. With the U.S. out of the deal, economic sanctions against the top oil-producing country are back on the table.

With the prospect of a supply shortage in the Middle East looming, crude prices skyrocketed to three-and-a-half-year highs. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures for June delivery rose 0.59% to $71.56 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent crude futures gained 0.25% to $77.40.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE) surged 2.04% Wednesday and rose 0.34% in premarket action Thursday. Chevron Corp. (CVX) closed higher 1.7% Wednesday and rose 0.14% Thursday ahead of the opening bell. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) rose 2.36% Wednesday and continued higher 0.1% Thursday morning. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) was among the top performers in the S&P Wednesday, up 5.4% by the closing bell. Shares were higher 0.42% Thursday morning.

While stocks were rising stateside, reactionary unrest continued overseas.

Israel and Iran traded rocket fire overnight near Golan Heights on the Syrian border in some of the most intense fighting in the region in several years. The Israel Defense Forces said it intercepted several rockets fired from Syria, which it said were launched by the elite Quds Force division of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News that the clashes were a ""further demonstration that the Iranian regime cannot be trusted and another good reminder that the president made the right decision to get out of the Iran deal.""

3. -- Sears Announces Tire Tie-In With Amazon

Sears Holding Corp. (SHLD) announced at its annual meeting that Sears Auto Centers will join forces with Action Alerts PLUS holding Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to offer consumers full-service tire installation and balancing, ""rolling out to customers across the U.S. over the coming weeks.""

""With this collaboration, Sears Auto will become the first nationwide auto service center to offer Amazon.com customers the convenient Ship-to-Store tire solution integrated into the Amazon.com checkout process, which is easy and convenient,"" Sears said. ""Amazon customers simply select their tires, the Sears Auto location and their preferred date and time for the tire installation. Sears Auto Centers then contacts them to confirm their appointment.""

Sears stock soared 16% on Wednesday following the announcement. Shares rallied 1.25% premarket Thursday.

The deal comes as Sears continue to do battle against a barrage of online and eCommerce threats to its core business. The 125-year-old company has watched its sales decline for years as online offerings from Amazon and others have eaten into its business.

Sears already sells Kenmore home appliances on the Amazon platform.

4. -- RBS to Pay $4.9 Billion in DOJ Settlement

Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS) will pay $4.9 billion in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its role in selling toxic mortgage-backed securities, the bank said Thursday.

The $4.9 billion payout comes as remittance for RBS' role in issuing and underwriting the mortgage-back securities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2007. The settlement will be paid as a civil monetary cash penalty. RBS said that about $3.46 billion of the payment will be covered through existing provisions, while about $1.44 billion will be taken as a charge to the bank in the second quarter.

RBS stock climbed 2.76% in premarket trading Thursday.

5. -- Ford Slashes F-150 Production in Wake of Fire

Ford Motor Co. ( F ) announced late Wednesday that the fallout from a May 2 fire at a Michigan supplier plant is expected to halt production of the popular F-150 trucks and potentially other vehicles. Ford didn't offer a specific timeline, but said the production cut could last days or weeks.

Ford leaders said they don't expect the fire and resulting production halts to have any effect on sales to customers or to necessitate a change to Ford's full-year earnings guidance of $1.45 per share to $1.70 per share. The company did say it will see a near-term financial impact from the incident, but would not quantify the impact for media representatives on the Wednesday call.

The cut to F-150 production comes just weeks after Ford announced it plans to all but totally abandon car production to focus its efforts on expanding its lineup for the ever-popular F-series trucks and SUVs.",2018-05-10,Amazon

Market Overview

Global stocks powered ahead Wednesday, with U.S. and European markets supported by surging energy stocks, as investors reacted to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from a multilateral nuclear treaty with Iran and the prospect of several months of rising crude prices.

Domestic oil producers and services were rising, with Transocean Litd (RIG) rising 5.5% and Actions Alerts PLUS holding Schlumberger NV (SLB) gaining 1.9%. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) jumped 2.3% while rival Chevron Corp. (CVX) added 1.7%.

Watch what the Iran deal means to oil prices.

""We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction,"" Trump said Tuesday in his White House address. ""Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States."" ""Today's action sends a critical message. The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them,"" Trump insisted. Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude producer with daily output of 3.8 million barrels, is likely to lose customers for around 500,000 barrels of oil each day, analysts have argued, once the full force of the sanctions kick-in over the next six months.

Vodafone Plc (VOD) shares were also on the move, rising 0.84% after the world's second-largest wireless carrier agreed a $22 billion deal to buy several European media assets from John Malone's Liberty Global (LBTYA) .

Toyota Motor Co. (T) shares rose 4% after it unveiled plans to buy back around $2.7 billion worth of shares Wednesday after the world's biggest carmaker forecast a 15% decline in profits for the coming financial year thanks in part to a stronger yen and ongoing trade rift between Japan and the United States.

The cautious tone reflects investor concern that Trump's largely unilateral decision to walk away from the Iran treaty, which was designed in 2012 to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for broader international economic support, will not only disrupt global oil markets but also unsettle the Middle East region and complicate the President's efforts to negotiate workable trade deals and compromises with America's biggest trading partners.",2018-05-09,Schlumberger

Trump recently claimed that when searched by the term ""Trump News"", Google displays results that are primarily from ""Fake News Media"". The President took to Twitter TWTR to allege that Google ""rigged"" its search results just to malign him.



Moreover, Trump lambasted Google and others for bypassing conservative opinions and favoring ""left-wing"". He also accused them of ""hiding information and news that is good.""



In response, Google falsified the accusations and said that its search results are never biased ""toward any political ideology."" Nevertheless, Google-parent Alphabet's stock took a hit, losing almost 1% at the close on Aug 28.



Trump's Bitter Ties With Tech Companies



Google and Twitter are the latest tech companies to make it to Trump's bad books. Per Reuters, Trump warned Google, Facebook FB and Twitter ""to tread carefully.""



Since Trump took oath of office in November 2016, his dealings with tech behemoths like Amazon AMZN and Facebook have been rough. This can be primarily attributed to the fact both the companies' CEOs - Jeff Bezos (owns Washington Post) and Mark Zuckerberg - have openly criticized Trump and his policies.



Trump loves to hate Amazon, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .



The President has time and again said that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance for package delivery. Also, Trump believes that the country's tax-paying retailers are shutting stores due to Amazon's relentless assaults.



Trump didn't spare Apple AAPL as well, which currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The iPhone maker was criticized for focusing on other nations instead of creating enough manufacturing jobs in the United States.



Apple's plan to pump $350 billion into the U.S. economy over the next five years (including $55 billion in 2018) following Trump's tax-cut initiative resulted in a truce. The stability in Apple-Trump relationship was evident from the fact that CEO Tim Cook, who is known for his left-wing lineage, dined with Trump on Aug 11.



Are Tech Stocks in Rough Waters?



Notably, tech stocks have gained significantly from Trump's tax cuts and repatriation policy. The higher amount of cash has not only allowed tech majors to bump up share buybacks to record levels but also pursue strategic acquisitions. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has returned 18.2% so far this year primarily backed by these factors.



Moreover, the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems, wearables, virtual reality/ augmented reality devices, artificial intelligence opens up significant opportunities.



Amazon, Alphabet and Twitter are well-poised to cash in on this opportunity banking on fundamental strength despite increased possibilities of regulations post Trump's warning.



Notably, Trump's repeated bashing had negligible impact on Amazon. Per data from Yahoo Finance, Amazon's stock has jumped 90% since Trump's first attack on Jun 28, 2017. Notably, the stock has returned 65.3% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.









Amazon is benefiting from an expanding AWS enterprise customer base. Additionally, the company's growing distribution footprint bodes well for Prime. We believe these positives will continue to drive Amazon.



Despite the 1% drop in share price, we believe Alphabet is immune to any threat from Trump's tweets due to its indisputable dominance in the search market. Moreover, Alphabet's focus on innovation, Artificial Intelligence, cloud, home automation space, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to drive its top line.



This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has returned 18.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.







Twitter is Trump's favorite platform, which guards it from threats. This Zacks Rank #3 company has returned 47.8% on a year-to-date basis.







The company is benefiting from strong growth in the international market and video advertisements. Twitter's focus on boosting user growth rate and engagement levels by adopting various measures like making tweeting easier and more expressive are expected to be major growth catalysts in the days ahead.

However, those estimates for unit volumes and market share only consider the first-party devices that Amazon and Google sell. If you include all of the third-party smart speakers that integrate Google Assistant, Alexa, or both, then the reach of those voice assistant platforms gets even bigger.

Sonos , which recently went public , is also transitioning its product portfolio, starting with the Sonos One released last year and more recently the Sonos Beam, both of which integrate Alexa. As of the first quarter, Sonos had sold over 4.6 million products on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, according to its prospectus. The product mix is unclear, but the company does attribute its volume growth to the Sonos One.

At this point, most of the prominent high-end audio players are aggressively working to include third-party virtual assistants in order to capture some of the incredible growth that the product category is currently enjoying.

And then there's Apple

In contrast, Apple is pursuing a familiar strategy of strict hardware-software integration. Siri is widely considered less capable than Alexa and Google Assistant, but third-party manufacturers don't even have the option to integrate it if they wanted to. It's worth acknowledging that some major improvements are coming for Siri in iOS 12, including a new Shortcuts app that will allow users to automate common tasks and create customized workflows. But within the smart speaker market, those improvements will only benefit HomePod owners.

While Apple was the first to launch a virtual assistant, Amazon was the first to open up its virtual assistant to third-party developers , turning it into a vibrant platform full of third-party innovation. Apple was right to recognize the potential of voice-powered interfaces in enabling new computing platforms, which led it to acquire Siri in 2010, a deal pushed by ex-software chief Scott Forstall. But in the years since, Siri has taken a back seat to rivals. Can it ever catch up?

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-blue-chip-tech-stocks-to-buy-now-cm1014422,"After several months of volatility, tech-heavy indexes are back near their all-time highs, and bullish investors look ready to push things even higher. The world's tech leaders have dominated Wall Street over the past two years, and now, investors might have a fresh chance to buy these red-hot stocks as they look to establish a new range.

Of course, this year's volatility has made some investors hesitant, with bearish traders quick to draw similarities between this latest tech rally and the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s.

However, unlike the dot-com bubble, there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally. In fact, the average P/E ratio of our "" Computer and Technology "" sector currently sits at 22.2, which compares favorably to the dot-com era's average that soared into the 100s for a few weeks.

Another interesting trend in today's tech rally is that, rather than obsessing over the next big thing, investors seem to rewarding tried-and-true brands for their respectable growth. This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love.

With that said, check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now:

1. Apple Inc. ( AAPL )

Tech behemoth and iPhone maker Apple has become a backbone stock for many investors in recent years, and the company is well on its way to reaching the $1 trillion market cap threshold for the first time ever. Plus, the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has its eyes set on the near and distant future.

Indeed, Apple is reportedly poised to introduce three new iPhones in early September, underscoring its new model which places the flagship smartphone at the center of diverse ecosystem of other devices and services, such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Music.

And after another great quarter, Apple has seen a tidal wave of positive estimate revisions for future fiscal periods, indicating that analysts are still growing more bullish on the company. Investors also have an opportunity to get in on the cheap, with shares trading at just 18.7x forward earnings right now.

3. Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT )

Apple may have reached the $1 trillion market cap threshold first, but not far behind it and a few other gargantuan tech companies sits Microsoft, a software pioneer in the midst of a cloud-computing-back rejuvenation. Microsoft is coming off another solid quarter, tallying better-than-expected earnings and revenue results and growth of 89% in its Azure cloud division.

Microsoft's great quarter-and ensuing analyst revisions-have earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Positive estimate revisions for 2019 and 2020 have been pouring in, and the stock is surging higher. However, with a PEG ratio of 2.1, MSFT does not seem overvalued when considering its impressive growth opportunities.

3. Texas Instruments Incorporated ( TXN )

Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. Its Embedded Processors make it a budding Internet of Things play, while its Analog solutions ensure it remains a diversified chip leader. TXN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Texas Instruments tells a classic growth and income story right now. For a firm of its size, it's still improving the top and bottom lines well, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 32% and 8%, respectively, this year. Meanwhile, the company has a healthy cash flow and pays out a strong dividend. Its yield is about 2.2% right now.

It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/how-to-read-a-companys-profit-and-loss-statement-cm1014456,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Investors tend to know the basics about earnings when they pick potential stocks. They understand earnings-per-share and year-over-year growth and how to compare a company's figures to Wall Street's estimates. But many investors don't understand much more than that, like what calculations go on to determine a company's bottom line.

That's where a profit and loss statement comes in. It's the behind-the-scenes of the final earnings number that gets released each quarter (alongside the company's balance sheet and cash flow) and repeated across financial news outlets.

A profit and loss statement (or income statement) breaks out revenue, often by segment, and then costs, and subtracts the two to get profit, which we all know is the same thing as earnings. But let's go a bit further. Here is how to read deeper into a profit and loss statement. We'll use Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) profit and loss statement as an example.

How to Dive Deep Into a Profit and Loss Statement

In the 2017 annual statement, Apple reported revenue of $229 billion and that revenue cost $141 billion, leaving the company a gross profit of $88 billion. But if you scroll down a bit, you'll notice other figures. For example, the company posted operating income of $61 billion and net income of $48 billion.

So what's the difference?

Operating income represents the company's profit, minus the day-to-day costs of running its business, which are known as operating expenses. In 2017, Apple spent $11.6 billion on research and development, plus $15.3 billion on selling, general and administrative expenses - the two most common buckets of operating expenses. This figure is also sometimes referred to as ""earnings before interest and taxes"" - or EBIT.

Another subset of operating expenses, though its not always broken out on websites that summarize the financials of publicly traded companies, is direct costs or cost of goods sold (COGS). Operating expenses like rent or utilities don't count here, but everything you spend directly on making a product or delivering a service does count.

Net income, on the other hand, means more figures are subtracted from the bottom line, including - you guessed it! - interest and taxes. In 2017, Apple's income tax expenses totaled $15.7 billion. But it also made $2.7 billion in additional income. So that income gets added to the operating income, then the $15.7 billion gets subtracted to get the company's net income of $48.4 billion.

Now, technically, that's the company's net income from continuing operations. The final net income figure would also factor in non-recurring events - discontinued operations or extraordinary items. But because Apple, according to its statement, didn't have any of those, the figure is also it's final net income figure.

Understanding the calculations that go into a company's quarterly and/or annual earnings figure is important to understanding its business model and what affects fluctuations each quarter/year. As such, the profit and loss statement is one important component of a fundamental analysis that every investor should master.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/how-apples-trio-of-new-iphones-could-drive-unit-growth-cm1014327,"Over the past couple of years, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone unit volumes have not really been growing much, languishing in the single digits. The first-ever decline in iPhone unit volumes occurred back in 2016 , with shipments mostly stabilizing since (subject to seasonality). Instead of relying on unit growth, Apple has leveraged its pricing power to generate revenue growth, a strategy that has worked wonders following the release of iPhone X last year.

This year, the Mac maker is expected to release a trio of new iPhones: a 5.8-inch OLED model, a 6.5-inch OLED model, and a 6.1-inch LCD model. The launch of those new handsets could help Apple drive iPhone unit growth.

Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown.

Suppliers are expecting a busy fall

DIGITIMES reports that prominent Apple suppliers Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor are expecting to post record revenue in the quarter following the launch. Foxconn has long been Apple's most prominent contract manufacturer, and TSMC has enjoyed a lock on producing the company's A-series processors for a couple of years now. Total shipments of the new lineup are estimated to hit 70 million to 75 million between the September launch through the end of the year, which would make it the most successful product cycle since the iPhone 6 release in 2014. That launch benefited from pent-up demand for larger phones.

Image source: Apple.

While Apple has reported shipments of around 75 million to 78 million iPhones in all December quarters since 2014, it's worth noting that those are total iPhone units, including previous-generation models. The tech titan does not typically disclose granular details around its product mix, although CEO Tim Cook said on the May earnings call that iPhone X was the best-selling model for every week during the March quarter. If the 2018 lineup can command shipments of 70 million to 75 million from mid-September through the end of 2018, then it's quite conceivable that Apple could see stronger unit growth than investors have become accustomed to in recent years.

Pricing will be key

How Apple prices the new models will be of utmost importance, following widespread concerns that the iPhone X's $999 starting price last year limited its appeal. Adopting OLED for the first time was undoubtedly the most significant cost driver, but those costs may come down this year, in part because Apple is reportedly bringing on LG Display as a second OLED supplier. Apple could choose to keep those cost savings for itself, benefiting its margins, or pass along those savings to consumers in the form of lower prices, benefiting unit volumes. The company needs to find the right balance between profitability and volumes.

For what it's worth, longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted (via MacRumors ) in June that the company would adopt a ""more aggressive"" pricing strategy after last year's criticisms. Kuo expects the 5.8-inch OLED model to be priced between $800 and $900, the larger 6.5-inch OLED model to cost $900 to $1,000, and the 6.1-inch LCD model to be $600 to $700. Those expected price ranges would make the 2018 lineup much more affordable relative to the 2017 lineup -- iPhone 8 started at $700 and iPhone X topped out at $1,150 -- while bringing newer technologies like 3D sensing and Face ID to more customers.

There are some challenges with walking back iPhone pricing , but doing so would probably be the right call for the iPhone business.

According to a report from Bloomberg published yesterday, Apple AAPL is set to unveil three new iPhones during an annual event in early September. These devices will all reportedly work from the iPhone X framework, with some within the company describing the launch as an ""S year,"" according to Bloomberg .

The report also indicated the sizes of these phones, with one apparently keeping the 5.8 inch display of the X and another offering a 6.5 inch display, which would be the largest ever screen on an iPhone. Bloomberg also said that Apple would reveal a more affordable model with a 6.1-inch display.

While excitement over the reveal will likely be muted in comparison to the massive step forward that was the iPhone X, these rumored smartphones are a logical progression for Apple as it continues to grow and groom its device and services ecosystem.

Apple is no longer interested in attracting brand new customers; instead, it wants to guarantee iPhone-for-life users by delivering a consistent slew of phones, all while developing accessory-like products and services-like the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Music-which use the iPhone as their foundation.

The Cupertino, California-based technology pioneer has also gradually raised the average selling price for its flagship line of smartphones, meaning that it makes more money per unit and can cash in on loyal fans who frequently upgrade.

As Ryan explains on today's episode, this makes sense considering where Apple is as a company right now. The consumer electronics king just touched the historic $1 trillion market cap threshold, and its iPhone sales have been stuck in the 0% to 5% growth band for years. This type of plateau demands a new perspective.

So what you should investors know about the new iPhones? Which other business segments have been key catalysts for Apple recently? Check out the show to hear Ryan's answers to these questions, and many more!

Leading the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of plans for 3D Touch. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday.

Source: Apple

3D Touch : A new rumor claims that 3D Touch isn't going to be around for much longer , reports BGR . According to this rumor, Apple is planning to ditch the feature from its smartphones in the near future. Some rumors also note that it won't be present in the budget 6.1-inch iPhone coming out later this year. The feature doesn't see much use and is expensive to add to devices, which is why future iPhone lines may not have it.

iPhone Shipments : Recent reports suggest that this is going to be a big year for iPhone shipments , MacRumors notes. These reports claim that AAPL will see the largest shipments of iPhones since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2014. These reports come from insiders in the company' supply line, as well as the guidance from iPhone manufacturers. The sources point to the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone as playing a large factor in the high shipments this year.

Project Titan : More patents concerning Project Titan are showing up , reports AppleInsider . This includes two new patents around the Apple car. The first has to do with a new type of sunroof that would slide down the rear of a vehicle. The second is for seats that provide passengers with haptic feedback. This feedback can allow the car to notify passengers about various bits of information without the need for visual or audio cues.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/4-etf-picks-as-nasdaq-hits-8000-cm1014187,"The Nasdaq Composite index closed above the 8,000 mark for the first time on Aug 27. U.S.-Mexico breakthrough trade talks and solid gains by some big tech names made this possible. Also, sturdy U.S. economic growth, a healing labor market and a rising rate environment drove this growth index. Most importantly, the Atlanta Fed raised its estimate for the Q3 U.S. GDP to about 4.6% from 4.3% .

Monday's gains were mainly boosted by FAANGs - Facebook's FB 1.6% rise, Apple's AAPL 0.8%, Amazon's AMZN 1.2%, Netflix's NFLX 1.61% and Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL 1.6%. FAANGs have been sizzling for quite some time. In fact, Apple has finally become the first U.S. trillion-dollar company this month.

The stock market got extra lift on Aug 27 from subsiding trade tensions between the United States and Mexico as the duo agreed upon a new bilateral trade deal (read: Spread of ETFs to Taste Apple's Trillion Dollar Market Cap ).

Investors should thus note that while several corners of the market are beaming with opportunities, a specific benchmark, the Nasdaq, is expected to be on fire as we progress further into 2018. The index is already up 14.4% this year compared with 7.5% returned by the S&P 500 and 4.9% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

This is especially true as the index is heavy on the technology sector, which is cash rich and is a key beneficiary of the tax reform. Investors should note that the Fed has enacted two rate hikes so far this year and is widely expected to tighten the policy again in September despite President Donald Trump's disapproval for higher interest rates. An improving economy and a moderately rising interest rate environment are great for cyclical sectors like Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary (read: September Rate Hike Odds High: Bet on These ETFs ).

While many are nervy about stretched valuation and a '2000-style crash' of Nasdaq, most experts are of the opinion that these fears are unwarranted. Bespoke Investment Group noted that in 1999-2000, the surge was all about tech but the latest run consists of "" tech and a lot of other companies ."" It speaks more of fundamental strength. For investors interested in riding out this uptrend in Nasdaq, we suggest a few ETFs.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/buy-apple-stock-because-the-next-iphone-cycle-may-be-the-big-one-cm1014305,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

For Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), there was a time when everyone was talking about the iPhone X ""super cycle."" Analysts were saying that the new-and-improved iPhone X would have enough bells and whistles to spark unprecedented upgrade demand, and that such demand would push AAPL stock way higher.

That never happened.

Instead, the iPhone X was pretty much a flop from a demand standpoint. AAPL stock dropped after prelim iPhone X numbers were released. But average selling prices on the phone were high, and Apple's other businesses (namely, Services and Apple Watch) have been red hot. So, AAPL stock has since rebounded from that big iPhone X sell-off and is now at all-time highs.

AAPL stock is a long-term winner because of robust growth potential in the Services business. But when it comes to the iPhone business, I think the investment community had it all wrong. Last year wasn't the super cycle - this year will be the super cycle. And that super cycle could lead to super-charged gains in AAPL stock over the next several quarters.

Here's a deeper look.

The Big Screen Trend

Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is set to launch three new phones this year, all three of which will have the edge-to-edge screen design that is characteristic of the iPhone X.

This is a smart move from Apple. Big screens are the future. Just think about all the popular apps these days around the world. They have all migrated from limited visual, News Feed format, to full screen visual, Stories format. Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP ) and Instagram are Stories platforms. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) are trying to pivot into Stories. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is too. Even Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has incorporated Stories format into its app with movie trailers.

Everywhere you look, full screen is in.

Why? Because the phone is the new TV. It is no secret that media and content consumption and engagement are shifting online, and in particular, shifting to mobile. As this shift plays out, the phone becomes more and more like a personal and portable TV. Think about the evolution of the TV. It went from bulky with thick black framing, to thin with edge-to-edge screen display.

Smartphones are making that transition right now, and Apple appears to be leading the charge. The iPhone X was the first of its kind. These three new phones are the next generation of this evolution. Overall, over the next several years, this big screen migration should help Apple sell a ton of iPhones.

Right Phones at the Right Time

If edge-to-edge display is the future, and the iPhone X had edge-to-edge display, then why was iPhone X demand relatively weak?

Price. The iPhone X debuted at an unprecedented $1,000 price point. While that added to the grandeur of the iPhone X launch, it also reasonably subdued demand.

Now, though, Apple is launching three new phones with that same edge-to-edge display, and those three phones will ""will boast a wider range of prices, features and sizes to increase their appeal,"" according to Bloomberg . Different features and sizes are cool iterations. But the big thing here is price. Apple will finally be selling a next-gen edge-to-edge display iPhone at a price point presumably far lower than $1,000.

By doing so, Apple is removing the one big barrier that kept people from buying the iPhone X: price. With that big barrier removed, demand for these new edge-to-edge iPhones should be huge.

Moreover, these phones are launching at the right time. Consumer spending, confidence, and optimism are all soaring right now. Just look at the huge numbers retailers have been reporting recently. Both Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ) just reported decade-best results. Meanwhile, the personal savings rate in the U.S. remains high, trade tensions are easing, the economy is improving, unemployment remain slow, and the stock market is soaring to all-time highs.

In other words, the consumer has every right to be confident today, and that confidence will likely remain for the foreseeable future. Naturally, then, big summer spend should flow into big holiday spend, and that positive consumer backdrop coupled with new, lower-priced phones should help Apple sell a ton of iPhones in the 2018/19 season.

Bottom Line on AAPL Stock

The market got it wrong. The 2017/18 iPhone upgrade cycle wasn't the super cycle. Instead, the 2018/19 iPhone upgrade cycle will be the super cycle. That super cycle, on top of super-charged growth in Apple's Services business, should drive healthy gains in AAPL stock over the next several quarters.

Consequently, long AAPL stock seems like the smart trade at this point in time.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, FB, TWTR, and GOOG.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is fast approaching its annual September iPhone event, and the launch of new hardware that's expected to cement its position as the world's first trillion-dollar company.

The iPhone will be front and center, naturally. The product that has driven AAPL stock for the past decade is still key to the company's continued growth. How many new iPhone models will there be, what shape will they take, and how much will they cost? What other new products might Apple show off on stage in what has all the signs of a monster fall release ?

Speculation has been running rampant, but as the date approaches, the pieces are falling into place. The first is the date.

Apple hasn't sent out the invites yet, but based on past patterns (where the iPhone event took place on the Tuesday or Wednesday of the second week of September), that means September 11 or 12. And since 9/11 is not the date most companies would intentionally choose for a product release, the smart money is on Wednesday, September 12.

Here's everything else we might see at this fall's big Apple iPhone event.

Apple iPhone Event 2018: iPhone X and new LCD iPhone

Source: Apple

Last year's iPhone X was an interesting release for Apple. The 10th anniversary iPhone was divisive. The notch wasn't popular at first, there were production issues with its advanced TrueDepth cameras and the $999 starting price raised concerns.

However… the iPhone X ended up selling well, the notch has become the most copied feature in this year's crop of Android smartphones and any manufacturing challenges with the TrueDepth camera were resolved long ago.

Expect Apple to release a refreshed iPhone X (think ""s"" level spec upgrades). And to win over price conscious shoppers, all signs point to a new 6.1-inch LCD iPhone which will be more affordably priced - likely in the $600 to $700 range. The affordable iPhone will have the notch popularized by the iPhone X, along with its TrueDepth camera. And it's expected to come in a range of bright new colors, in a throwback to the iPhone 5c.

Apple iPhone Event 2018: iPhone X Plus

Source: Apple

With the iPhone X, Apple learned that selling slightly fewer iPhones than previous years can pay off in a big way. A $999+ smartphone drives up ASP (average sale price), and a higher ASP can translate into big revenue gains.

A rising ASP is a big reason why AAPL stock has continued its run , despite softening iPhone sales.

Expect the company to make a play to keep that ASP on an upward trend - despite the new, affordable LCD iPhone - by adding an iPhone X Plus to the lineup. This one is pegged to have a 6.5-inch OLED display, the biggest ever on an iPhone and slightly larger than Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 phablet. There are also rumors both the iPhone X and iPhone X Plus could support the Apple Pencil stylus , in another shot at the Galaxy Note.

If AAPL keeps the iPhone X at $999, expect the iPhone X Plus to cost at least $1,100. Add in the rumored Apple Pencil support (a $99 accessory) and many consumers could be shelling out record prices for their new iPhones this year.

Apple has been relentless about releasing a new Apple Watch every year. We haven't yet seen the Apple Watch Series 4 and last year, Apple chose the fall iPhone event to announce the Series 3.

That means the odds are good we'll see the Apple Watch Series 4 announced in a matter of weeks.

Look for the Apple Watch Series 4 to have 15% larger displays (AAPL is expected to trim bezels to keep the physical size the same), with an improved heart rate monitor. Potential upgrades that have gained some buzz include an integrated UV monitor for sun exposure, sleep tracking and boosted battery life.

If there's one product announcement that seems like lock at the fall iPhone event - besides new iPhones - it's the AirPower wireless charger.

Why?

Because Apple actually announced it last year. And after waiting all year without the promised charging mat (which will wirelessly charge new iPhones, the Apple Watch and AirPod cases), the company has changed the product page to state ""available 2018.""

With a new crop of iPhones being announced, all supporting wireless charging, it would be embarrassing for AAPL to still not have its own wireless charging solution available.

The last of the sure bets for the next iPhone event is the release of Apple's latest operating systems. While the company will be launching new OS versions for everything from the Apple Watch to Apple TV, it's iOS 12 and macOS Mojave - the operating systems that power iPhones, iPads and Mac computers - that will get the spotlight.

Look for cool new features, but a focus on performance and stability. Apple traditionally makes its new operating systems available as a free download in the weeks after the iPhone event.

Apple iPhone Event 2018 (Longer Shots): New iPad Pro With FaceID

Source: Apple

We are as certain as is possible with the always-secretive Apple that the company is planning a fall release of at least one new iPad Pro model that borrows technology pioneered with the iPhone X.

The new iPad Pro would lose the TouchID fingerprint sensor, adopting TrueDepth cameras and FaceID. As a result, bezels would be thinner, allowing Apple to use a larger display without increasing the iPad Pro's physical size.

Apple itself has accidentally leaked a hint of the new iPad Pro in a beta of iOS 12. The big question is whether the company will announce the new iPad Pro model (or models) at the iPhone event, or wait until October.

Apple iPhone Event 2018 (Longer Shots): New MacBook Air Replacement

Source: Apple

Rumors have been circulating since the spring that Apple is working on a replacement for the aging MacBook Air .

That would make sense, given that the MacBook Air - which is extremely popular and the most affordable laptop in the Apple lineup - looks the same as it did a decade ago, uses an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) CPU that's generations out of date, and lacks a high resolution display.

Apple's new, affordable laptop will have a Retina display with thinner bezels and USB-C support, but we still don't know whether it will look like the current MacBook Air, or the ultra-thin MacBook, or whether it will even be called a MacBook Air.

We're also not sure when it will arrive, but signs point to a fall release, and that means it could be announced at the iPhone event.

Apple is also reportedly preparing to announce a replacement for the Mac Mini.

The most affordable Mac hasn't been upgraded in four years. Rumors are flying that AAPL is planning a new Mac Mini this fall. It will likely require macOS Mojave, so there's a possibility the company might just trot the new Mac Mini out on stage at the iPhone event when it runs the traditional mac OS demos.

Apple iPhone Event 2018 (Longer Shots): New Audio Hardware

AAPL appears to also be working on a slew of new audio products. While some are long shots in terms of whether they even exist, others have been confirmed within the supply chain and at least one could even make an appearance at the iPhone event.

New AirPods wireless earbuds that support Siri in hands-free mode seem the most likely bet for September. The company is also reportedly preparing to launch Apple-branded, high performance wireless headphones. And with HomePod sales not exactly setting the smart speaker market on fire, there have rumors that Apple will release a smaller, less expensive version this fall. A HomePod ""Mini"" that cuts the original's $349 price would be much better able to compete with the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Echo and other smart speakers.

Did we guess right? We won't find out if Apple has managed to keep some secrets until September - probably September 12. When the big event takes place, be sure to check out InvestorPlace, where I'll have a roundup of the new products and the upside for AAPL stock as soon as Apple CEO Tim Cook walks off the stage.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202479-amazon-2-trillion-2020?source=nasdaq,"If all goes well, AMZN could still rush ahead of AAPL and beat its peer at becoming the first ever $2 trillion company.

To invest in Amazon, I believe one must look past the results of next quarter or current year and project financial results farther into the future.

I have always had a hard time making sense of Amazon (AMZN) as an investment vehicle. I continue to believe that talking about the company and the stock in terms of next quarter's earnings or this year's revenues is futile. After all, a forward P/E of 110x or an EV/sales of 4.0x (on razor-thin margins) could only lead to one logical conclusion: AMZN is an overpriced stock to avoid.

Credit: ABC 13 Eyewitness News

Roughly one year ago, I argued instead that investing in Amazon required ""2020 vision"". That meant that, in my opinion, one must try and project the company's results at least three years out in the future, ideally more, to decide whether buying the stock today makes sense.

To do so, I revisit my 2025 projections from back in the early part of 2017 and make adjustments given the developments of the past one and a half year. By doing so, I hope to answer (or at least take a stab at answering) a couple of key questions: does AMZN deserve its nearly $1 trillion valuation? And if so, can the stock continue to head up, perhaps at the same 44% per year pace that it has experienced in the past five years?

Deeper roots in North America

The North America segment represented a sizable 60% of Amazon's total revenues in 2017, and its growth, surprising to some, has not shown any sign of slowing down. The company seems to have used a strategy of horizontal expansion to keep momentum going strongly - think, for example, of the Whole Foods acquisition that not many saw coming, or Amazon's head-first dive into content creation and distribution with Prime Video. Despite the richer fulfillment, marketing, and content costs that the growth strategy demands, the North America segment has seen unadjusted operating profits rise by a factor of four YOY last quarter.

Last year, I believed Amazon could deliver what now seems like a very timid 20% revenue increase in 2018 that would slowly dwindle to the low single digits by 2025. Today, I recognize that my expectations have been set too conservatively: growth in the first half of 2018 has reached an impressive 45% already - although comps should get tougher by this year's holiday season. I now do not expect the revenue increase to dip below 10% until 2025, with near-term prospects looking much rosier than I originally envisioned.

International expansion

This is perhaps Amazon's least developed segment. After having transformed the retail landscape and disrupted other industries (like media) in the U.S. and neighboring markets, quite a bit more work is left to be done beyond the North American borders. Roughly 18 months ago, when international sales of $44 billion in 2016 had been growing at a 24% clip, the company's CFO spoke of fulfillment expansion being more balanced between domestic and global in order to address the international opportunity.

Since then, international revenues have increased at an average 25% rate over the past six quarters, with the most recent holiday season (one of Amazon's most impressive) experiencing robust growth of 29% that was followed by 1Q18's even better 34%. Amazon seems to have a blank canvas in terms of what product or service initiatives it may choose to pursue in what countries - it seems to me that Prime and Alexa-enabled devices have been key priorities. Also very importantly, scale (of fulfillment infrastructure and marketing efforts, for example) is finally providing some lift to profitability, and GAAP operating loss has started to narrow.

In 2017, I foresaw international revenue growth landing at 30% in 2018 and declining steadily towards GDP-like growth within eight years. Today, I maintain my expectations for top-line growth in the near term but see it declining at a less steep trajectory in the coming years.

AWS execution

If I ever considered buying AMZN in the past, Web Services was likely a key reason to do so - I elaborated further in my two-year-old but still relevant 2016 article on the subject. The relatively small segment (12% of total revenues in 2Q18) is an able generator of op profits (55% of total company's last quarter) and gains of scale here are likely to support Amazon's margins going forward.

As it turns out, my mild fears over fierce competition and price pressures in the cloud storage, and computing spaces have proven to be a bit overdone. Amazon has been able to reignite growth in AWS in the past three to four quarters, as the graph below illustrates. This was probably enabled by a combination of the secular transition to cloud solutions, a strong macroeconomic environment that has encouraged digital infrastructure investments, and Amazon's competence at providing a good product at a competitive price despite the success of competing services like those of peer Microsoft (MSFT).

I now expect cloud services growth to surpass the 40% mark in 2018, with the decline over the next eight years averaging about four percentage points per year. See historical trend in AWS revenues and top-line growth below.

Plugging in the numbers

As evidenced in the narrative above, Amazon has delivered well beyond my early 2017 expectations. Despite the size of the company, one of the largest in the world, there seems to be quite a lot of revenue and op profit growth opportunities yet to be realized, from horizontal expansion domestically to international penetration to gains of scale driving increased margins.

Looking at the near term first (i.e. next 12-18 months), I believe the Street's expectations for 2019 revenue growth of 22% suggests to me a significant deceleration in Amazon's footprint expansion - something that I find unlikely, absent a more severe deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals. Therefore, I would not be surprised to see upward revisions in top-line estimates in the upcoming months, should Amazon continue to execute as well as it has over the past few years.

Switching to the long term (two to five years at least), I don't find it unreasonable to project double-digit revenue growth through 2025 which, coupled with expanding margins, might conceivably produce what I estimate might be $40 in EPS by 2021 (roughly $20 billion in net income and 500 million shares outstanding) vs. $25/share projected for next year. Should Amazon be able to deliver against this aggressive growth benchmark, it is unlikely that its stock would suffer much in terms of multiple contractions. At a forward earnings multiple of 100x, EPS of $40 would imply $2 trillion in market cap by the end of 2020 - roughly 37% annualized share price appreciation that looks doable in the context of trailing five-year trends.

Those optimistic enough to believe that the Amazon story has barely begun may find today's valuation justifiable and see an investment in the stock still enticing. To them, AMZN may have lost the race to $1 trillion in market cap to Apple (AAPL). But if all goes well, the stock could still rush ahead and beat its peer at becoming the first ever $2 trillion company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202710-qorvo-strengths-apart-apple-relationship?source=nasdaq,"The adoption of 4G is not fully realized and still has room to expand.

Qorvo's product portfolio and its manufacturing capabilities offer customers a value that is difficult for competitors to replicate.

Once again, the high expectations of both investors and analysts for the future revenue of Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) have begun to mount, thanks to the imminent arrival of the new generation of iPhone.

This year, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to launch three new iPhones, all with OLED displays, and offer versions at a lower price than the previous iPhone X. If the company can persuade more customers to update their current devices by offering lower-priced options, this cycle could counteract the disappointing results of the last cycle.

Following the expectations placed on sales of the new iPhone, it is expected for the next quarter that Qorvo reports revenues in the range of $850-860 million, representing an approximate growth of 4% compared to the same period last year.

Although this new cycle for Apple has revived the interest of investors in Qorvo, this company has other strengths that are important to highlight and that could result in significant growth in the long term.

The global adoption of 4G still has room for expansion

Telecommunications operators and government organizations continue to invest in 4G LTE networks, especially in regions such as China, India and Latin America, which seek full coverage by 2020. Likewise, the growing demand for high-bandwidth data services by consumers is forcing telecommunications operators to provide efficient services at lower costs.

For this reason, the global 4G LTE market value is expected to reach approximately $322.77 billion, growing at a compounded annual rate of 38% during the period between 2017 and 2023.

(Source: Extracted from the Investor Day presentation 2018, slide 48)

Given that 4G coverage still has room for expansion, the adoption of 4G smartphones has not been fully realized, leaving ample room for suppliers of radio frequency (RF) components, such as Qorvo, to grow.

An important aspect to consider is that 4G LTE networks are based on a wide variety of wireless spectrum frequencies, more than 40 bands and counting, so RF filters are required for each of these bands in order to accurately capture these wireless signals. We see that in the long term, 4G LTE signals will continue to be assembled from a growing number of different frequencies or bands, so 4G phones will continue to require dozens of filters per device.

However, as LTE networks continue to mature, there will be some pressure on prices from large companies such as Apple, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Huawei towards Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that may partially offset this strong growth.

Extensive package of products and manufacturing capabilities

The rise of 4G LTE smartphones has been exponential in recent years, driving both Qorvo and competing RF companies. Despite this, we believe that only a handful of companies, including Qorvo, have the size, scale and quantity of product depth needed to integrate and supply the hundreds of millions of RF filters needed by smartphone manufacturers.

Likewise, the complexity in the process of smartphone manufacturers has meant that there is not a single firm that monopolizes the manufacture of each filter within each LTE smartphone, so we see Qorvo maintaining a good market share in RF supply going forward.

RF industry leaders like Qorvo have years of experience in design, manufacturing, packaging and testing chips. We consider the manufacturing process to be especially valuable because most RF products are based on ever more specialized materials. It is expected that smartphone manufacturers will continue to build increasingly more advanced 4G LTE phones that will require even more advanced RF content.

At the same time, RF leaders such as Qorvo continue to work closely together with their customers to design and launch new devices. Given the low price of RF filters, we anticipate that smartphone leaders such as Apple and Huawei will continue their relationship with Qorvo. We do not believe that these companies will run the risk of poor-quality connectivity in their devices just to save a few cents on a lower-quality filter with another provider or risk a startup without the size and scale to manufacture and supply hundreds of millions of filters.

Non-mobile markets

Qorvo has been introduced as a supplier of RF chips in other industries, such as wireless infrastructure and military end markets. While we consider that the designs in these segments are less prone to pressure on prices by their customers, these end markets have not boosted the company to stellar profits.

Despite the diversification of the company in these other industries, the future of the company is still linked to smartphones. We hope that its infrastructure and defense products (IDP) segment will become a more relevant source of revenue for Qorvo in the medium term.

Currently, applications in this segment include high-performance defense systems such as:

Radar

Electronic warfare and communication systems

Wi-Fi CPE for home and work

High-speed connectivity in LTE and 5G base stations

Cloud connectivity via data center communications and telecom transport

Automotive connectivity and other IoT

Smart home solutions

Although the outlook for the IDP segment looks promising in the long term, it currently represents a small portion of Qorvo's total revenues.

For the first quarter of 2019, the company reported $486 million from its mobile products, representing 70% of total revenues, while the IDP segment delivered $207 million, or 30%. This dependence on the company's mobile products is likely to continue in the short and medium term, until Qorvo penetrates more into this promising market segment.

(Source: Data extracted from filing from the SEC)

Qorvo’s risks

First, a significant concentration of Qorvo's revenues comes from its most important customer, Apple, which for fiscal year 2017 represented 34% of all revenues. It would be a damaging blow for the company if it ever lost an iPhone design cycle.

Second, even if Qorvo maintains its stake with smartphone leaders, technology titans such as Apple and Huawei could exert significant price pressure and request significant volume discounts from the company in the long term.

On the other hand, a high-end smartphone such as the iPhone X uses RF components from different providers, including the fiercest competitors of Qorvo, in order to ensure LTE connectivity through the different LTE bands. Therefore, however unlikely in the short term, we cannot rule out the possibility that the company may be displaced within the design of the iPhone in the future.

Finally, product life cycles in the RF industry are exceptionally short, so a successful Qorvo design may not translate into a steady long-term revenue stream. Overall, the real value of a Qorvo design victory will ultimately depend on the commercial success of its customers' products.

Quick valuation

After strong growth of 16% in the fiscal year 2017 (ending in March 2017) and a soft market that caused a sales decrease of 2% in fiscal year 2018, we project a good rebound for Qorvo with 11% growth in sales in fiscal year 2019. We anticipate the company will gain more RF content in the current iPhone cycle, while continuing to grow in its IDP segment.

QRVO EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YCharts

On the other hand, the valuations of the company that have been characterized as cyclical seem to be reaching high levels again, which indicates an anticipation by investors of the new iPhone cycle. This highlights the strong dependence that Qorvo has on the results of Apple.

We believe that the share price does not yet reflect the results and returns of its IDP segment because this is not yet significant compared to the revenue of mobile products. For the time being, we estimate a tight safety margin of 10% in the medium term, depending on the commercial success of the iPhone or expectations of the same.

But the stock price continues to face pressure. Mr. Market is just not happy with this company.

The company is doing very well when it comes to what you'd think might be important - making lots of money.

Walgreens is one of my last 'losers' from the 15 Dividend Achievers that I skimmed in early 2015.

I bought Walgreens (WBA) back in early 2015 as part of my real-life, real monies index skimming (VIG) exercise. I skimmed 15 of the largest cap Dividend Achievers. That included WBA and CVS Health (CVS). The stock prices of those two companies continue to face pressure. The greatest fear is that Amazon (AMZN) will have their lunch, or at least eat into their business in a very meaningful way. I have no idea if that will turn out to be the case. I don't know the future. Given that, this article should be succinct and to the point, and we'll let the images do the talking.

Here are two charts that don't seem to make sense, at least when you see those charts together. Here's the topline overview of the financials with thanks to Morningstar. As you may know, Morningstar is a wonderful resource for free financial information. Investors can also sign up to pay for a Premium Service.

And here's the stock price history thanks to portoliovisualizer.com. This is a total return chart without the reinvestment of dividends. The period is January of 2015 through to end of July 2018.

We have revenue and earnings and dividends and cash flow and profitability going up over time (in a meaningful way). We have the share price that continues to fall.

The share price has seen a small jump in August. Here's the one-month chart from Seeking Alpha.

Of course, the above scenario might be a classic target for the value investor - yes thanks for stating that Captain Obvious. They like to see business success going one way (up) and the stock price going the other (down). That can create a scenario where you are able to buy generous current earnings. You can see that by the P/E ratio of 16.17 from the Seeking Alpha chart. Morningstar lists the forward P/E ratio at just over 10. Of course, the forward PE takes into account the projected earnings as per analysts.

The stock market voting machine currently says no to Walgreens. But the stock market weighing machine will eventually have to put those revenues and profits on the scale. That is, if those revenues and profits continue to move in that direction.

Now, my readers will know that I'm not one for complicated evaluation. I am mostly an index skimmer. And when I make a pick or two Apple (AAPL), BlackRock (BLK), I keep it simple. Is there an obvious trend that leads to business success moving forward? I then look at that simple financial breakdown as per the offering above from Morningstar. Are they making money? Are they making more money? Are they sector leaders?

These days, though, there is some chatter on Seeking Alpha concerning Walgreens and its prospects. Here's an article from Eli Inkrot - It's Time To Consider Walgreens.

Healthy Wealth Coach suggests you can Buy It and Thank Jeff Bezos.

While the article is for PRO subscribers, the bullet points suggest…

History clearly shows a trend of Wall Street overreacting to fears about Amazon's entry into new markets.

These fears typically bring about fantastic buying opportunities.

Walgreens is now trading at a single-digit valuation on the exact same fears.

It's not different this time.

For the record, I have avoided any evaluation or guesswork on the Amazon effect. I continue to hold, and I did add to Walgreens 3 or 4 times over the last 3 years. I'll admit to not knowing the future.

All said, I can see why the CVS's and Walgreens are getting the attention of investors. They are also getting the attention of the smart beta value indices such as Invesco's S&P 500 Pure Value Index Fund (RPV).

If those 2 charts don't make sense, then the market makers have this one terribly wrong. But it's not easy to know when the pros have it wrong. It's just their guess trying to look into the future.

Only time, only the future will tell.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202630-price-discovery-stock-buybacks?source=nasdaq,"And it asks the question: What would price discovery (fair value) look like in the market if companies no longer had the ability to buy back their stock?

Of interest is the behavior that is incentivized by US companies using cash flow to reduce share count (value creation), which compounds the risk for investors to buy and hold stocks that engage heavily in stock buybacks.

Given our current polarized political arena, buybacks have also been criticized for compounding wealth for the few while crowding out wages for the many.

Stock buybacks are often credited for underpinning the market's amazing Bull Run since the early 1980s, and especially the past ten years.

Tailwinds from a low-interest rate environment, central bank liquidity, depreciating U.S. Dollar and stock buybacks have been the cornerstones of the U.S. market’s advance. Macro Risks – whether from political missteps, monetary tightening, economic growth concerns to currency/trade war posturing – have not seemed to deter the Buy-The-Dip crowd. So I decided to have a closer look at this US phenomenon of corporate stock buybacks, their effect on price discovery of late and how a potential shift could be on the horizon against this powerful tool of stock appreciation and how it could be masking a potentially large blind spot in the investing public.

It is common knowledge that companies are increasingly using buybacks as a substitute for dividends. It is less known/understood that management has a proclivity to buy high and not buy low, that buying back overvalued stock can help boost EPS which can also help management reach its financial objectives faster (and its bonuses that are tied to those objectives).

Compensation for CEOs in the past 30 years has moved from one based heavily on salary and bonus to one much more sensitive to stock price performance. 99 Most pronounced is that many executives are now focused on boosting the stock price by whatever means they can rather than focusing on creating value, which ultimately gets reflected in the market price. -- Credit Suisse, pg 49

It shouldn't surprise, then, that buybacks for 2018 are expected to reach a fever pitch – to a record $1 trillion, a 46% rise from last year – thanks to tax cuts, repatriation and a strong equities market. Add to that, corporate cash is being channeled back into leveraged credit, resulting in five times the equity buybacks. This is a type of ‘closed loop’ system that requires a major upset to break the loop - which could come in the form of Regulation.

Buybacks are a byproduct of our markets since 1982, when it became perfectly legal to distribute capital to shareholders without causing them to incur unwanted tax liabilities as with dividends. Their interest would stay inside the asset/stock where it could compound over time. Needless to say, share buybacks have largely outpaced and in many cases replaced dividend income. And with so much available, cheap debt and excess cash in US corporations, it makes sense that those companies that can take advantage of buybacks, do! But at what cost?

Buybacks have been essential fuel for the low-volatility regime, enabling steady equity appreciation and in turn, the rules-based strategies pegged to that tranquility. Now, as volatility returns to equity markets, buybacks will likely prove key to understanding and anticipating the threat of a high-volatility crash. -- 13D Research

Volatility reprices everything. And since stock buybacks prop up share prices, without them, valuations could suffer. So let me return to my core question and ask:

It it wasn’t for AAPL buybacks, would it really be a $1T company?”

I firmly believe AAPL is a great company albeit with slowing growth - but instinctively I felt its share price could not be ‘this high’ without the scarcity effect of stock buybacks - simultaneously reducing outstanding shares despite the opposing impact on the market cap. And then I found this chart which is representative of so many tech companies engaging in this practice of 'value creation.'

Here is the chart from Bloomberg's analyst David Wilson.

Reductions in the iPhone maker’s outstanding shares explain 42 percent of the increase in its stock price from 2013 through Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The percentage reflects Apple’s current market value and the peak number of shares: 6.58 billion, recorded at the end of 2012. The share count dropped 26 percent through June 30 to 4.84 billion, a figure cited in the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings release.

Let that sink in: Apple's share price is assessed to be 42% higher since 2013 due to stock buybacks.

Another ‘closed loop’ system is more insidious: A study found that in 2017 and early 2018, the percentage of insiders selling stock more than doubled immediately after buyback announcements. CEOs are cashing out as they announce stock buybacks that buoy the stock price higher.

This is just another version of my “Sold To You” mantra of late with companies like FB - Insider Selling.

The later stages of the 2009–2017 bull market are a valuation illusion built on share buyback alchemy… Share buybacks are a major contributor to the low volatility regime because a large price insensitive buyer is always ready to purchase the market on weakness… Rising corporate debt levels and higher interest rates are a catalyst for slowing down the $500-$800 billion in annual share buybacks artificially supporting markets and suppressing volatility. - Artemis Capital

I am reminded of the last few chapters of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator wherein Jesse Livermore’s character details the difference between stock Speculation and Manipulation – both of which he was privy to. His last chapter is a call to ban/remove stock buybacks from the exchanges. Color me skeptical but I am connecting these analytical touch points – like the 90 yr insights by a master trader - with the foreboding macro backdrop which is seemingly interpreted as bullish (as evidenced by incessant buying of any dip) and the growing body of evidence to link income inequality to monetary and fiscal policies.

Add to this the fact that the richest 10% of Americans own about 80% of all shares of stock (the top 1% owns about 40%), and you get a broader picture of how and why inequality has widened so dramatically. - Robert Reich

Then my mind wonders further. If we didn’t have pervasive financial engineering in the form of corporate buybacks, would profits actually find their way into wages as a way to help resolve the glaring inequality gaps? Yes, it would cause the ubiquitous wage inflation that so many analysts and economists have feared/talked about, but it would also lift up the standard of living that could in turn spur more sustainable consumption and real economic growth.

How much might workers have benefited if companies had devoted their financial resources to them rather than to shareholders? Lowe’s, CVS, and Home Depot could have provided each of their workers a raise of $18,000 a year, the report found. Starbucks could have given each of its employees $7,000 a year, and McDonald’s could have given $4,000 to each of its nearly 2 million employees. - National Employment Law Project and the Roosevelt Institute

The report is careful not to draw a causal relationship between stagnant worker pay and rising buybacks. I’m calling that out. The report examines the period just before President Donald Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut came into effect and the tax legislation that cut both the top marginal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent - dropping the estimated effective tax rate on profitable businesses to just 9 percent. I’ll leave it to a future report to update the effects on income equality with tax cut figures fully baked in but it's likely 'Yuge.'

So here we are: Big Picture 1st Half 2018 Review time

We have market strength, as evidenced by year-to-date positive returns in the indices despite Macro Risks, and Corporate Earnings have been a smashing success - breaking records! But there are cracks: Wage growth has been slowing. Construction has been slowing. Jobs added have been slowing. Auto sales have been slowing. Home sales have been slowing. Home prices have been declining. And all against a backdrop of rising Inflation, Deficits and Buybacks. So I came to ponder: maybe the market only cares about buybacks?

And if the market really only cares about buybacks, what if politics shift to challenge stock buybacks. If I was a betting woman, I would say the current holders of power are invested in taking credit for the market advance and invested in the market's returns = no change. The next-in-line, however, may have other ideas - like not allowing members of Congress to own individual stocks and other conflicts of interest. Elizabeth Warren has even proposed partially banning stock buybacks.

So that keeps bringing me back to the same Serious Question: What would happen if stock buybacks – $1 T slated for the Top Ten stocks in 2018, out of a $23 T stock market capitalization for 2000 equities in the NYSE – were removed? What would price discovery for our markets look like then? Well, if we go back to the Apple example, and the idea that shares are 42% higher since 2013 due to straight share reduction from buybacks. So if you're a bull, you definitely don't want companies or government regulation to interfere with this gravy train. If you are not in the Top 10% of Americans, your quality of life is clearly much different from the Top 10% and would likely benefit from a little help to level the playing field.

Political and Corporate powers are currently aligned on this issue of maintaining and vigorously defending the right to buy back stock, and the Citizenry is not really aware how Income Equality and Price Discovery are collateral damage to Stock Buybacks. Until this changes, the market has few event risks that challenge its structural advance - or at least until the structure of stock buybacks is changed.

(AAPL) gearing up to roll out new iPhones this fall, suppliers of the parts that go into the smartphones are expected to have their strongest fourth quarter ever in terms of orders.

That’s according to DigiTimes, which, citing unnamed sources, reported that shipments of new iPhone models are expected to be between 70 million and 75 million by the end of this year, which if true would be the best performance since Apple launched the iPhone 6 in September 2014. The strong shipments are expected to bode well for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Foxconn, both of which supply components or assemble the devices for Apple. While the Cupertino, California-based smartphone maker hasn’t actually said when it will roll out new iPhones, it usually launches new models in September.

Apple’s New Devices, Price Point To Drive Sales

It is widely rumored that Apple will launch three new iPhones, two of which will have the bendable OLED screen and one LCD screen based model. The OLED phones are expected to come in a 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch models while the new LCD version is expected to be 6.1 inches, reported DigiTimes. The 6.1 inch LCD is rumored to be reasonably priced and that, coupled with new design and functionality in the OLED models is seen driving a replacement cycle for Apple, and thus the strong supply orders. The iPhone X was the first Apple device to include an OLED screen, but the $999 starting price has shut out lots of potential buyers. (See also: Apple to Launch Latest Batch of Updated iPhones. )

TSMC, Foxconn, Pegatron to Benefit

The report noted that most of Apple’s supply partners are expecting to see sales increase significantly, peaking in the fourth quarter of 2018. Taiwan Semiconductor, which handles foundry orders for the A12 processor chips for the new iPhones, has seen revenue start to increase beginning in July, offsetting a steep decline in demand from crypto mining companies. DigiTimes noted that TSM is expected to have revenue of between $8.28 billion and $8.38 billion during the current third quarter and for that to rise to between $10.4 billion to $10.5 billion in the last three months of the year.

As for Foxconn and Pegatron, the two companies that assemble the new iPhone, sources told the paper that Pegatron is handling the majority of the OLED screen assembly and 30% of the assembly of LCD models. Meanwhile, the report noted that Foxconn’s profitability in the last six months of this year is projected to be higher than the first half of the year, thanks to the iPhone.",2018-08-28,Apple

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/apple-aapl-rumored-to-launch-three-new-iphones-this-year-cm1014057,"Apple AAPL is now rumored to launch three new iPhones in September. Per TechCrunch, which quoted a Bloomberg report, the company is anticipated to launch an updated iPhone X, a bigger iPhone and an iPhone 8 that will feature iPhone X design.





It is highly anticipated that the updated iPhone X will be powered by Apple's latest A12 chip with a 5.8-inch OLED screen. The latest chip will ensure faster processing speed and better camera performance.The bigger phone is expected to have a 6.5-inch display along with stainless steel edges, two cameras on the back and an OLED display.The iPhone X inspired iPhone 8 is expected to be the cheaper version this season. The device is likely to have aluminium edges instead of stainless steel edges as found in iPhone X. Moreover, it is anticipated to have a single camera on the back and a 6.1-inch LCD display.Apple's fortunes are tied to iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 56.1% of net sales in third-quarter fiscal 2018 that benefited from higher average selling price (ASP) and customer loyalty.

Apple Inc. Price and Consensus

Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote

The company sold 41.3 million units of iPhones. Although the company sold only a few hundred more iPhones than it did a year ago, segment revenues were 20% higher. This was primarily due to 19.5% boost in iPhone ASP, which was $724 in the quarter.



The three new devices promise strong growth prospect for Apple, prior to the upcoming holiday season. Although none of the devices will be completely new like iPhone 6 or iPhone X, the upgraded internal features are expected to attract new customers. Further, unflinching loyalty for iPhone is a key catalyst.



Moreover, the company's focus on selling more iPhones at a higher ASP is expected to drive the top line, going forward.



Services to Boost from Steady iPhone Sales



Further, steady volume of iPhone sales ensures continuing demand for Services, which has emerged as the new cash cow for the company.



Services - including revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services - surged 31% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2018.



Apple Music is one of the biggest new growth areas in Services. The company is gaining market share against Spotify SPOT in the U.S. market. Moreover, increasing adoption of Apple Pay is strengthening competitive position of the company against the likes of Square SQ and PayPal PYPL .



Notably, Apple is on track to double Services revenues of $24 billion in fiscal 2016 by 2020.

U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning. Wall Street's trade fears have eased somewhat in the wake of the just announced U.S./Mexico agreement. The Donald Trump administration said that talks with Canada are up next. Still, trade worries linger as U.S./China talks have made no real headway.

Bulls continue to outweigh bears, however, as futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.14% this morning. Additionally, S&P 500 futures have added 0.13% and Nasdaq-100 futures have rallied 0.26%.

In the options pits, calls dominated the landscape yesterday as volume took off. Overall, about 21.6 million calls and 13.7 million puts changed hands yesterday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to a seven week low of 0.51. The ramp up in call activity also pushed the 10-day moving average to a five week low of 0.61.

Tech and finance were the hot sectors for options traders on Monday. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) drew a spike in call volume on news the financial giant filed a cryptocurrency patent.

Elsewhere, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) was pulled higher by momentum in rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). Finally, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) calls were popular on news CEO Jack Dorsey would testify before the U.S. Senate.

Let's take a closer look:

Bank of America (BAC)

Cryptocurrencies rallied and Bank of America stock gained ground on Monday. BAC stock rode the crypto wave after news broke that the bank applied for a blockchain patent for cryptocurrency storage . The patent describes an application that uses encryption linked to blockchain data blocks as a form of data security. So far, Bank of America has filed 50 patents related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Options traders ran with the news, piling into BAC stock call options. Volume on Monday rose to over 419,000 contracts, or about 1.5 times BAC's daily average. Calls claimed a whopping 79% of the day's take.

These typically bullish options have gained considerable traction on BAC stock in the front-month September series. Specifically, the put/call open interest ratio for September has fallen to a reading of 0.57 in the past couple of weeks. In short, calls nearly double puts in September, indicating that options traders are expecting BAC stock to rally though the month.

Nvidia (NVDA)

Rival AMD launched its new Radeon Pro V340 graphics card for virtual graphics processing unit workloads in Las Vegas this weekend. The new GPU takes aim at Nvidia's market-leading processors and could put pressure on Nvidia in the data processing market. Still, the bullish news lifted the sector as a whole, adding to NVDA stock's momentum.

For its part, NVDA stock attracted more than 215,000 contracts in the options pits yesterday. Calls gobbled up 65% of the day's take. That said, there is still lingering bearish sentiment on NVDA stock among options traders.

Specifically, the September put/call OI ratio rests at 0.95, with puts on the verge of parity with calls for the month. However, as NVDA stock gains momentum, we could see this negativity evaporate and more bulls come out in support of the shares.

Twitter (TWTR)

A pair of reports have helped TWTR stock rally in the past couple of days. First, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) announced a multi-annual streaming deal with Twitter for Overwatch League's highlights and live content.

Second, CEO Jack Dorsey will testify before the U.S. Senate on Sept. 5. Senate Republicans are expected to ask about social media companies removing content from conservatives, a topic that gained momentum following a Trump tweet, ironically.

TWTR stock jumped 4.7% yesterday, and options traders responded with a wave of call activity. Volume on TWTR rose to 172,000 contracts, with calls claiming 72% of the day's take.

Optimism remains high on TWTR stock among options traders, especially in September. Currently, the front-month put/call OI ratio comes in at 0.54, with calls nearly doubling puts for the series. That said, TWTR stock is still down nearly 30% from its 2018 highs.

As of this writing, Joseph Hargett held no position in any of the aforementioned equities.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/dow-out-of-its-second-longest-correction-territory-5-picks-cm1013988,"On Aug 27, one of the equity markets' most closely watched indexes - the Dow 30 - ventured out of correction territory for the first time in more than six months. Wall Street's bullish wave, which commenced in July, continues in August as the blue-chip index registered a gain in seven of the trailing eight weeks.



Recent optimism related to global trade war concerns, a robust U.S. economy and strong earnings results bolstered investors' confidence in the stock markets enabling the Dow to climb out of the rut. Such factors are likely to pave the way for further upside. Consequently, investment in some of the Dow 30 stocks with favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential will bode well.



The Dow Out of Correction Territory



On Aug 27, the Dow 30 gained 259.29 points or a little above 1% to close at 26,049.64. The index closed above 26,000 for the first time since Feb 1. This marks the blue-chip index's successful break out from the correction territory. Technically a stock breaks out of correction territory when it rises 10% from its correction low.



The index had entered correction territory on Feb 8, when it declined more than 10% from its all-time closing high of 26,616.71 recorded on Jan 26. In order to bust out of the correction territory, the Dow needed to close 10% higher of its recent closing low of 23,533.20 on Mar 23. Finally, on Aug 27, the index managed to achieve that level.



The blue-chip index had remained under correction zone for 138 trading sessions. This was the Dow's second longest stint in correction territory after a 223-days session in 1961. At present, the index is just 2.2% away to from its all-time high closing level recorded on Jan 26.



Despite severe stock market volatility, the index is up 5.4% year to date. Moreover, a strong bunch of 16 stocks in the total portfolio of 30 have provided positive returns so far this year. Nine stocks have provided positive double-digit returns.





Trade-Related Concerns Ease



On Aug 27, President Donald Trump announced that the United States and Mexico have reached an agreement to enter into a new trade deal. The new deal would be called ""The United States-Mexico Trade Agreement"" and will replace the 24-year old ""North American Free Trade Agreement"" (NAFTA) which was formulated between the United States, Mexico and Canada.



Notably, Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, is scheduled to reach Washington on Aug 28 to resume talks between the two neighbors to formulate a new agreement replacing NAFTA. Infact, Canada is the second largest trading partner of the United States after China.



Although the details of the U.S. - Mexico deal is yet to be made public, market participants generally believe that the U.S. automobile industry will largely benefit from the deal. It is worth mentioning that the trading relationship between the United States, Canada and Mexico took a hit on Jun 1, when the Trump administration imposed 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% tariff on imported aluminum from the two neighboring countries.



Strong U.S. Economic Fundamentals



U.S. GDP grew at 4.1% in the second-quarter of 2018, marking its highest gain since the third quarter of 2014 and the third-best growth rate since the Great Recession of 2008-2009. In the second-quarter, consumer spending increased 4%, business investment grew 7.3% and government spending rose 3.5%. Moreover, unemployment rate in July fell 0.1% from June to 3.9%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years.



Our Picks



Stock markets momentum remained largely unhindered despite volatility. Massive tax cut, business-friendly policies and steady economic activities resulted in robust earnings results. U.S. markets are well positioned to attract investors' attention by offering high yields.



At this stage, we narrowed down our search to four stocks within the Dow 30, each having either a Zacks Rank #1 (strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and strong growth potential.

The chart below shoes price performance of our five picks in the last three months.





Microsoft Corp.MSFT : The stock provided a positive earnings surprise of 11.4% in the trailing four quarters. Microsoft has expected earnings growth of 9.5% for current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 7.3% over the last 60 days. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .



Apple Inc.AAPL : The stock provided a positive earnings surprise of 5.5% in the trailing four quarters. Apple has expected earnings growth of 26.8% for current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 2.5% over the last 60 days. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.



The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.GS : The stock provided a positive earnings surprise of 20.8% in the preceding four quarters. The Goldman Sachs has expected earnings growth of 26.5% for current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 6.9% over the last 60 days. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.

https://www.smarteranalyst.com/hedge-funds/will-selling-micron-mu-apple-aapl-help-revive-flailing-billion-dollar-fund/,"Hedge fund legend David Einhorn is feeling the pressure right now. In the second quarter his Greenlight Capital fund ditched a large chunk of its Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings. The crucial question now is: Will these big bear moves bring the fund better luck going forward?

Greenlight Capital is a “long-short value-oriented hedge fund.” The fund lost 5.4% in Q2, bringing its year-to-date loss to a whopping 18.3%. By contrast the market was up 2.6% in the first two quarters. Even Einhorn admitted to investors that “over the past three years, our results have been far worse than we could have imagined, and it’s been a bull market to boot.” Unsurprisingly, several investors have given up on the fund and sold out (details unknown).

In fact, the fund has performed so badly that it now holds approximately $5.5 billion in assets under management as opposed to about $12 billion back in 2014. The hedge fund manager blames the fund’s loss-making on missing Amazon, to large investments on Brighthouse Financial and General Motors- both of which have posted losses year-to-date.

“Right now the market is telling us we are wrong, wrong, wrong about nearly everything,” Einhorn wrote. “And yet, looking forward from today we think this portfolio makes a lot of sense.”

It wasn’t always this way- Einhorn’s fund generated 16.5% annualized return for investors from 1996 to 2016. And bear in mind he started with just $900,000 back in 1996. Plus the New Jersey-native isn’t doing too badly for himself. Forbes estimates his net worth at $1.52 billion (as of February 2018) making him the 18th highest-earning hedge fund manager in the world.

Einhorn is ranked #126 out of 202 hedge fund managers on TipRanks, with a 12-month average loss of 11.62%.

With this in mind, let’s now take a closer look at his most recent trades:

Micron: History Suggests Bear Turn Is Coming

Goodbye Micron. In Q2, Einhorn slashed the fund’s MU holding by 92%. He sold off 3,071,500 shares, leaving the fund with 275,500 shares valued at $14.477 million.

Given that the outlook from the Street is so bullish on MU right now, it’s worth considering what turned Einhorn so bearish on the stock’s outlook. According to the Street, Micron is a ‘Strong Buy’ stock with 18 recent buy ratings vs only 4 hold ratings.

These analysts have an average price target on MU of $83. From current levels that indicates robust upside potential of over 60%. Plus shares have been performing very well recently- year-to-date shares are up 27%, and this figure rises to 72% on a one-year basis.

However, there are fears that Micron stock is riding a very cyclical wave when it comes to memory pricing and demand. And this wave has to break soon. Stock skeptics point to the fact that Micron is at peak EBITDA margins. Following the historical pattern, this indicates a potential fallback 12 months down the line after EBITDA peaks. This is because once EBITDA reaches a high- supply adjusts accordingly with new capacity coming on line.

At the same time the current attractive valuation could be a sign of caution. On a forward EV/EBITDA basis, the stock trades at just 2.6x. But this raises the key question of whether investors are purposefully taking a back seat due to the current unsustainable EBITDA levels. No doubt Einhorn feels he has already benefitted from the stock’s recent growth spurt- and it’s best to sell before the cracks really show.

Already GS has put out a note suggest that NAND flash is oversupplied, and the outlook for NAND pricing is weaker for 3Q18 than currently. Also worrying, the note also that pricing could also soften for DRAM- a key source of chip stock revenue which has so far proved extremely lucrative (right now it accounts for about 2/3 of the company’s revenue). DRAM prices could ‘negatively inflect’ in 1H19 says GS as US hyperscale customers own more inventory. This means they can be more selective in their purchases going forward rather than simply buying without question.

Indeed, it is interesting to note that Einhorn isn’t the only hedge fund changing track on this red-hot chip stock. Hedge funds have drastically reduced MU ownership over the last 2 quarters.

Apple: The Smartphone Market Is in Decline

In Q2 Einhorn extended the bearish sentiment to Apple. He sold a whopping 486,000 shares in the consumer giant, effectively reducing the fund’s AAPL position by 78%. The remaining holding now stands at 142,100 shares worth $26.304 million.

He isn’t the only one feeling cautious about the trajectory of one of the world’s biggest stocks. Top Maxim Group analyst Nehal Chokshi has a Hold rating on AAPL. This comes with a price target of just $200- suggesting that shares can plunge by almost 8% from current levels. Apple doesn’t deserve an above peer multiple of over 15x argues Chokshi.

He made the call following Q2 earnings that revealed a worrying signal. While iPhone average selling prices (ASP) increased 20% y-o-y to $724, underlying key metrics for iPhone unit sell-out and normalized services q/q growth both came in on the weak side.

“Guidance implies iPhone unit sell-out on path to deteriorating to mid- to high- single-digit y/y declines” predicts Chokshi. In the meantime, one more quarter of high teen iPhone ASP growth should drive strong overall revenue growth. As a result, this top analyst has now lowered his iPhone sell-in estimate for the September quarter by 7% to 46.5M units (flat y/y) and sell-out estimate to 44.6M (down 2% y/y).

And longer-term the picture worsens. This is because he believes that a declining smartphone market (due to longer lifetime cycles and decreasing incremental users) will also herald the decline of iPhone selling prices. “Specifically, iPhone units & ASP will be in decline in FY19, resulting in our projection that iPhone revenue will be down 12% y/y” sums up Chokshi.

Overall, the stock sports a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. This breaks down into 16 Buy ratings, 12 hold ratings and 1 sell rating all within the last three months. The average analyst price target of these ratings works out at $212- just over 3% downside from the current share price.",2018-08-28,Amazon

By Ginger Gibson and Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Google's search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding ""fair media"" coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.

Trump's attack against the Alphabet Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc, which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc, which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favorable deal with the U.S. Postal Services. He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage.

Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for ""Trump News"" were ""rigged"" against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.

""I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,"" Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.""

Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.

Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google.

Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was ""taking a look"" at Google, saying the administration would do ""some investigation and some analysis,"" without providing further details.

Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.

In June Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google's alleged anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising markets.

Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws.

U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution: ""If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.""

Shares of Alphabet closed down 0.8 percent at $1,245.86.

TRUMP'S CRITICISM OF MEDIA

While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company's algorithms.

The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search.

Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump's most frequent targets, often appear first in search results.

Trump's accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia.

Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech.

Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons.

Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter's chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5.

Earlier this month, Alphabet's YouTube joined Apple Inc and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter.

White House probes Google after Trump accuses it of bias



By Ginger Gibson and Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Google's search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding ""fair media"" coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.

Trump's attack against the Alphabet Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc, which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc, which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favorable deal with the U.S. Postal Services. He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage.

Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for ""Trump News"" were ""rigged"" against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.

""I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,"" Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.""

Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.

Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google.

Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was ""taking a look"" at Google, saying the administration would do ""some investigation and some analysis,"" without providing further details.

Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.

In June Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google's alleged anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising markets.

Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws.

U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution: ""If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.""

Shares of Alphabet closed down 0.8 percent at $1,245.86.

TRUMP'S CRITICISM OF MEDIA

While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company's algorithms.

The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search.

Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump's most frequent targets, often appear first in search results.

Trump's accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia.

Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech.

Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons.

Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter's chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5.

Earlier this month, Alphabet's YouTube joined Apple Inc and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/here-are-the-best-ways-to-buy-the-dow-jones-index-cm1013779,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Many investors, especially the ones who only invest for retirement, prefer to stay away from individual stocks. Of this group, many simply want to follow indexes. Indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the United States offer a barometer of overall stock market performance. Despite the S&P covering more stocks, the popularity of the Dow 30 continues. Fortunately, investors who want to invest in the Dow Jones can choose from a wide array of exchange-traded funds.

Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones & Co. co-founder Charles Dow created the index in 1896. Today, the index consists of 30 large-cap stocks that define the overall market. As the name implies, it started out as an index of ""industrial"" stocks. As the index came to represent the overall market, the Dow Jones added non-industrial companies over time.

The index has also seen stocks added and removed as their size and importance increased or decreased. Companies such as Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) make up recent additions to the index. Firms such as AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) found themselves removed from the index as their importance declined. The Dow Jones eliminated the last original member of the index, GE (NYSE: GE ), from the index this year.

ETFs Offer the Only Pure Play on the Dow Jones

Although mutual funds that can track the Dow Jones exist, ETFs usually serve this purpose at a lower cost. For example, the two Rydex Dow Jones Industrial Average Funds (MUTF: RYDAX , MUTF: RYDHX ) place just over 80% of their assets in Dow 30 stocks. The remainder is split up between derivative instruments and cash. These require a minimum $2,500 investment and charge fees exceeding 1.55%. The same issues exist with the Rydex inverse funds that bet against the Dow.

For a Dow Jones pure play, no fund comes closer than the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA: DIA ). Global State Street Advisors established this fund in 1998. Barring the purchase of all 30 stocks at their specific weighting, DIA stock stands as the closest approximation to the Dow Jones available. As the name implies, it invests 99.8% of its assets in all 30 Dow stocks and it mimics the actual index in weighting. The fund charges an expense ratio of 0.17%, almost 90% less than the fees for maintaining RYDAX or RYDHX.

Leverage and Inverse Dow ETF Funds Are Also Available

Other indexes act as variations on the Dow. ProShares offers two leveraged Dow ETFs. The ProShares Ultra Dow30 (NYSEARCA: DDM ) reflects two times the daily performance of the Dow Jones. It achieves this by owning the overall stocks as well as derivatives and money market funds. Achieving such performance involves more active management. Hence, this fund charges a much higher expense ratio - 0.95%.

By the same token, the ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (NYSEARCA: UDOW ) mimics three times the daily performance in the same manner. Its expense ratio also comes in at 0.95%. Fortunately for their long-term investors, the decay factors that often affect leveraged ETFs have not sent these funds into a long-term decline. In fact, DDM has outperformed the overall Dow Jones, even when factoring in the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite that, huge moves upward can turn into severe spikes downward when the momentum shifts, so approach these leveraged ETFs carefully.

ProShares also offers an ETF for those that want to bet against the Dow 30. As the name implies, the ProShares Short Dow30 ETF (NYSEARCA: DOG ) moves in the opposite direction of the Dow. However, investors should only buy this equity in or near a bear market. Since the Dow has seen a steady rise since 2009, DOG stock has itself become a dog. After moving above $360-per-share in Mar. 2009, it has steadily dropped on the rising Dow Jones average. Today DOG trades at about $57-per-share.

Final Thoughts on Dow Jones Investing

ETFs offer investors a wide variety of ways to invest in the Dow Jones index at an affordable price. Such funds allow investors to invest in the Dow without purchasing all Dow 30 stocks at their specific weights.

Although investors can use mutual funds, they typically charge higher fees and do not cover the index as closely. DIA stock offers the only true pure play in Dow Jones investing. However, other funds also allow for investing at multiples of the index or for shorting it.

Not all investors want to invest in the Dow Jones. However, thanks to index funds, those that want a Dow tracker can invest in the Dow 30 according to their beliefs about its future performance and their risk tolerance.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/microsoft-pulls-an-apple-time-to-buy-msft-stock-cm1013740,"Shares of Microsoft MSFT popped nearly 1% Monday following news that the company is set to roll out a subscription service for Xbox that mimics how Apple AAPL treats the iPhone these days. The move could help Microsoft attract more users and create more customer loyalty in its gaming division, but MSFT stock looks like it might be a buy even without its latest Xbox announcement.

Xbox

Microsoft is set to let consumers bundle its video gaming offerings like never before. Customers can pick from either Microsoft's Xbox One S or the more powerful and more expensive Xbox One X. But unlike before, when gamers had to buy the console outright, they will now be able to make small monthly payments.

The tech giant is offering users the ability to pick between a $34.99 a month plan for 24 months for the One X and a $21.99 per month option for the One S. The monthly payments also include an Xbox Live Gold subscription-which lets users play multiplayer games online and access free games for $60 per year-and the Xbox Game Pass. The service allows gamers to download and play games from a library of select games for $9.99 per month.

Microsoft's idea here is pretty simple: to create more brand loyalty and more consistent revenue streams similar to Apple's new iPhone payment model. After the two-year period, the company will theoretically be able to offer upgrades on newer models in what MSFT likely hopes is a somewhat limitless cycle.

The move also highlights the growing popularity and strength of subscription services, from Netflix NFLX to Spotify SPOT . Interested customers will, however, have to sign up at a physical brick-and-mortar Microsoft store. Plus, the company has said that its new Xbox subscription service will be offered for a limited time -which could clearly change.

On top of this potentially game-changing Xbox subscription service, MSFT stock seems like it might be worth buying at the moment.

Business Overview

Microsoft has maintained its strong position as a software and hardware provider, while also diving into everything from artificial intelligence to cloud computing and IoT. The company has bolstered its business through acquisitions as well, which include LinkedIn and its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub.

Amazon still grabs the largest portion of the cloud market at 34%, but Microsoft came in at 14%, which topped IBM's IBM 8%, Google's GOOGL 6%, and Alibaba's BABA 4%, according to Synergy Research Group . Microsoft announced in the middle of July a five-year deal with Walmart WMT that will see the retail giant use MSFT's cloud and AI tech.

Plus, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud revenues surged 23% in its fiscal Q4 to hit $9.61 billion-the biggest quarterly gain of its three key business units. And its widely popular Azure cloud business skyrocketed by 89%.

Stock Price Movement

Now let's see how MSFT stock has performed over the last few years to help give investors a better idea of its current standing. Shares of Microsoft have soared roughly 150% during the last three years, which crushes its industry's 71% climb and the S&P 500's 45% jump.

MSFT stock has also surged 50% during the last 12 months. The company has seen its stock price cool off a bit over the last six months, up roughly 17%. But shares of MSFT are still currently trading right near their 52-week and all-time high.

Valuation

Moving on, MSFT stock is currently trading at 25.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a discount compared to its industry's 33.3X average. Yet, Microsoft has traded as low as 22.2X over the last year with a one-year median of 24.4X.

Shares of Microsoft are trading below their 52-week high of 26.9X. But investors can see that MSFT's current valuation picture appears rather stretched compared to where it has traded over the last five years.

Outlook

Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Microsoft's fiscal Q1 revenues to climb by nearly 13.4% to hit $27.83 billion. Meanwhile, MSFT's fiscal 2019 revenues are expected to reach $122.36 billion, which would mark a nearly 11% jump.

At the other end of the income statement, Microsoft's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by over 14% to hit $0.96 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 9.5%.

Investors should also be pleased to note that MSFT has earned 10 upward earnings estimate revisions for Q1 over the last 60 days, against zero downgrades. More importantly, the company has earned 15 full-year earnings revisions during this same time period, with nearly 100% agreement to the upside.

Microsoft's positive earnings estimate revisions trends help the company earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.

In 2018, many market observers have been quick to label the FAANNG group dead. But, quite simply, those pundits have been wrong.

Despite the FAANNG stocks enduring choppy trading in 2018 and being subject to some sizable drops, all six FAANNG stocks are up year-to-date. Even Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), which suffered the biggest stock market drop in history this year, is still up 1% YTD. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) is up nearly 20%, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is up about 30%, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is up more than 40%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is up more than 60% and shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) have nearly doubled.

Clearly, long FAANNG is still the market's favorite trade.

This will remain true into the foreseeable future. These companies are attacking huge and growing markets, and are rapidly gaining share in those secular growth markets. This trend will remain true for the next several years as more consumption and engagement moves online. As such, all of the FAANNG stocks should head higher over the next several years.

In the winning FAANNG group, I think one of the best long-term investments in GOOGL stock. This is a big growth company with a huge moat that dominates the digital advertising space, and it is gaining traction in other, even bigger secular growth markets. Plus, GOOGL stock is among the cheapest valued stocks in FAANNG.

For all those reasons, I think Google stock is the cream of the corp when it comes FAANNG. Here's a deeper look.

Google Dominates Digital Advertising

Make no mistake about it. The secular growth digital advertising space is essentially a duopoly between Facebook and Google. That dominance may be fading some, but the two tech giants still control more than 55% of the entire U.S. digital advertising market.

Within the duopoly, Alphabet stock is the bigger player by far. Facebook controls about 20% of the U.S. digital advertising market. Google controls over 35%.

Meanwhile, the whole digital advertising market is experiencing robust growth. Global digital media spending is expected to rise ~13% per year over the next five years as total ad spending growth converges on rapidly increasing digital media share.

Thus, it is safe to say that the company dominates the secular growth digital advertising space.

It is also safe to say that this dominance will persist. Alphabet is winning because Google is bigger. And, Google is bigger because Google is the gold standard for digital search, which is a must-have feature of using the internet.

No one comes too close to challenging GOOGL in digital search. Thus, so long as internet usage grows globally, GOOGL's dominance will only become more apparent.

As such, Google's digital ad business should continue to grow at a robust rate over the next several years.

GOOGL Will Dominate AI

Google dominates the digital advertising market today. But Google will dominate the AI market tomorrow, and that market has far greater growth potential.

When it comes to AI, everything is about data. Data is essentially the fuel which powers the algorithms behind AI. Fortunately for GOOGL stock owners, when it comes to data, Google is second-to-none. Because just about every internet user in the world (ex China) uses Google dozens of times a day, GOOGL has amassed the world's largest consumer preference and search database in the world.

Right now, Google is in the early stages of turning that enormous database into first-rate AI technologies. Think Google Home, Google Duplex and Gmail. All of these are AI-infused Alphabet products that, quite frankly, are best-in-market.

But, this is just the beginning for Alphabet stock's longer-term growth potential. Google is also experimenting with self-driving through Waymo, its autonomous driving unit, and gaining traction in the cloud market with Google Cloud.

Put it all together, and Alphabet is becoming a company with diverse exposure to all things AI. That means that growth outside of digital advertising should remain robust for the next several years as self-driving, cloud and smart home technologies emerge to the forefront.

Alphabet Stock Is Cheap

The best part about GOOGL stock is that it is dirt cheap considering the company's massive multi-year growth potential.

Google stock trades at just 26X forward earnings. That multiple makes the stock the cheapest stock in the FAANNG group outside of Apple and Facebook.

But, Apple is growing revenues at a sub-20% rate, and Facebook doesn't have ample exposure to all things AI. Meanwhile, Google is growing and it has consistently grown revenues at a 20%-plus rate, and it has ample exposure to all things AI. Thus, Alphabet's stock deserves a bigger multiple.

Moreover, a 26X forward multiple for 20%-plus revenue growth without any of the major AI drivers having really materialized yet is dirt cheap. As soon as those drivers materialize, this could easily turn into a 30%-plus revenue growth company. If that happens, the 26X multiple would look silly.

Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock

Google dominates the secular growth digital advertising industry, and it is positioned to dominate multiple AI markets over the next several years. That combination gives GOOGL stock a powerful growth narrative for the foreseeable future. But GOOGL stock isn't being priced for all that big growth.

As such, not only is Alphabet stock supported by powerful long-term growth drivers, but the risk-reward on the stock looks exceedingly favorable here and now.

That makes GOOGL's stock a long-term buy-and-hold.

Leading the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of a delay for the 6.1-inch iPhone. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Monday.

iPhone Delay : Yet another rumor claims that the 6.1-inch iPhone will face a delay , reports 9to5Mac . According to this rumor, the 6.1-inch iPhone won't be coming out at the same time as the other two smartphones. This is the budget LCD iPhone Apple is reportedly planning to release this year. The rumor says that AAPL will release its more expensive OLED brothers next month. However, the LCD version won't make it in time for a September release. The source of this rumor is analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

iPhone Lineup : Sources inside Apple are revealing more details about the upcoming iPhone lineup for 2018 , Bloomberg notes. The publication's sources claim that there will indeed be three new iPhone models coming out in 2018. It also notes that many insiders at the company are referring to 2018 as an ""s"" year. This likely means that there won't be major changes to the form factor of smartphones coming out this year when compared to the 2017 iPhone 8 and iPhone X.

iOS 12 Beta : New versions of the iOS 12 beta are up for download , reports MacRumors . This includes the 11th version of the beta for developers and the 10th version for public testers. These new beta versions are coming out just a few days after the previous ones. This suggests that iOS 12 is getting closer to its final release. This makes sense as AAPL is likely to show off its newest iPhone devices next month. The devices will most likely ship with iOS 12 installed.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-pros-and-cons-of-buying-disney-stock-cm1013718,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

One of the most fascinating business stories of recent years has been whether the big media titans that dominated the media environment of the 20th century can adapt to the new world of smartphones and streaming services. Among Hollywood's stalwarts is Disney (NYSE: DIS ), which has aggressively moved to stay ahead of the curve. Before you buy Disney stock, consider these pros and cons of one of media's most powerful entities.

The conglomerate recently made a move that should pay off big: After fending off rivals such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Disney has finalized a deal to buy an enormous piece of 21st Century Fox's assets. Disney's top managers, including CEO Bob Iger, believe that acquiring Fox's film and TV production operations will enable Disney to stay one step ahead of upstart rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).

Once it integrates all the new Fox assets into the existing Disney network of production and distribution, the company is planning to launch its own standalone streaming service before the end of 2019. Competition is already fierce in that market, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also making noises about getting into it. But Disney has been supplying popular content for almost a century, so investors would be foolish to bet against it.

Of course, Disney was a movie studio before it was anything else, and the company has been getting fantastic results so far this year in that segment. Black Panther became a pop culture phenomenon as well as a box office blockbuster, and fans are already eager for the sequel. Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2 were also big hits.

One possible negative on the horizon for Disney has been the declining performance of its once-mighty cable sports channel, ESPN, which has been hurt by a variety of factors, including the ongoing political controversies involving the NFL and the increasing migration of younger fans toward niche markets like mixed martial arts. But Disney still has several well-placed assets in the TV segment, including the ABC broadcast network.

Diverse Operations

The diversity of Disney's operations is positive for Disney stock. In addition to the entertainment content discussed above, Disney's theme parks and merchandise are world-famous and attract a steady stream of customers.

The price of DIS stock has been sliding in recent weeks. Is this a pro or a con? The downturn happened because many analysts were underwhelmed by the company's latest earnings report. Its third-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.87, eight cents less than the consensus prediction.

In fact, DIS stock has been a bit of a laggard over the last three years, although its appreciation during the preceding five-year period was quite strong.

Shares of Disney have climbed 260% over the last ten years, which outpaces the S&P 500's 127% climb. However, during the last five years, DIS stock is up just 75% compared to the S&P's 72%. DIS stock has moved sideways over much of the last three years, lagging the index and its industry.

The conglomerate's latest financial results tip the balance toward the ""pro"" side. The stock's price-earnings ratio of 14 is now below the market average, which seems very low for a company that has been an industry leader for so long and continues to innovate. The stock's dividend yield of 1.5% is nothing extraordinary, but Disney's enormous cash flow - almost $10 billion during the last 12 months - makes the payout very secure.

So the final verdict on DIS stock is that the recent decline in the price represents a buying opportunity since the shares would be an excellent addition to a long-term growth portfolio.



As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The bite is back in Netflix (NFLX), a FANG stock that had tumbled more than 20% from July 9 through Aug. 17. A disappointing second-quarter report in mid-July didn't help.

Shares of the streaming service are up 4% today, on top of last week's gains of 12%, to lift the stock to $371.77-its highest level in more than a month.

And at least one Wall Street analyst doesn't think the recovery is over. Piper Jaffray's Craig Johnson told CNBC on Friday that he anticipates a ""longer-trend upward.""

The stock has also attracted interest off reports that Netflix is testing a feature to bypass Apple's (AAPL) App Store for sign-in fees in Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Japan. The conceivable hole in Apple's walled garden would enable consumers to pay for Netflix directly via a web page on their smartphones, thus enabling them to avoid paying Apple its cut of the fee, according to RBC Capital Markets.

The streaming service got a further boost late last week, when SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold in anticipation of new momentum in the market in India. He did, however, lower his target price to $410 from $415.

""We are encouraged in India where search data shows NFLX initial original series resonating quite well and interest in NFLX rising on an absolute basis and relative to competitors,"" Thornton wrote in a research report.

Neflix's rebound comes as heartening news to investors still smarting from the company's second-quarter report that showed it added far fewer subscribers than Wall Street was expecting. The company added 5 million people to bring its total members to 130 million.

Despite the recent run-up, Netflix remains well short of its all-time-record high of $423.21 set June 21.

It's good to be the King. Right now, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is the King of tech, and AMZN stock is the King of tech stocks.

While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is getting deserved praise for exceeding $1 trillion in market cap, AMZN stock is at $935 billion, more than doubling Apple's gains so far in 2018.

Amazon's revenues continue to grow 40% year-over-year, despite hitting almost $178 billion last year. The tech giant's net income has already exceeded 2017's $3 billion, and analysts are far more optimistic about the future of AMZN stock than that of Apple.

Amazon's success has given it a political halo outside its hometown of Seattle. There are 20 cities still competing fiercely for its HQ2 project, which is impacting the local politics of many municipalities.

Take Atlanta for Instance

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms is using HQ2 to distract from a burgeoning scandal. HQ2 is being touted as a possible lead tenant in a planned downtown project over an old railroad yard called ""The Gulch.""

""The Gulch"" won't win HQ2. Amazon said last year it wanted 100 acres of raw land , which Atlanta could put together at locations the city has not touted. The Mayor is playing politics, not making a business case.

But it almost doesn't matter because Amazon's needs are so great. The company now has 17 tech hubs employing over 17,000 people, each focused on a different niche. The Boston hub works on Alexa, New York on fashion, Los Angeles on gaming. An Atlanta hub focused on technology for financial companies would make sense. With Georgia's 30% entertainment tax credit, which has already brought several studios to the area, Atlanta would also make a great operating headquarters for Amazon Studios.

Amazon also needs to expand the operating footprint of its low-margin retail operations. Atlanta's airport and trucking hubs south of the city offer huge advantages to distributors. Houses just south of downtown are also available for under $100,000 , and many areas west of downtown are not much more expensive. Those would all be good attributes for AMZN's retail hub. Amazon, in short, can transform Atlanta without giving it HQ2.

Strength to Strength for AMZN Stock

The point is that Amazon, like the other Cloud Czars, is rapidly becoming a national presence, with a national job footprint that it can leverage to shift public policy in many cities, not just Seattle and the HQ2 winner.

Analysts are currently expecting Amazon to have a $75 billion Christmas season, with total 2018 revenue of $234 billion , and total earnings of $17.31 per share. Its growth is expected to remain over 20% even into 2019, with revenue of $286 billion and net income of over $25 per share. That should make Amazon larger than Apple, but still less than 60% the size of Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT )

Hitting those targets will require Amazon to continue diversifying geographically. As I wrote a week ago, Amazon has ambitions in finance, in healthcare , and in advertising. Additionally, it is reportedly working on a new Fire OS phone that will be more closely integrated with its Prime Video program and its digital assistant, Alexa.

To make all of this work, Amazon will have to hire hundreds of thousands of new people. In 2016, Walmart was the country's largest private employer with 2.3 million employees. Amazon was second at 600,000. The tech giant could yet pass Walmart in both employment and sales. But getting there will require more than just an HQ2.

The Bottom Line on AMZN Stock Is Power

The Amazon Effect can be used, and abused, by politicians of all types, but it's based on the reality that the company continues to expand at an enormous rate.

So it barely matters where Amazon decides to put its HQ2. Many cities are going to win as Amazon grows, and the company is going to become an ever-larger political presence on the local, state, and national level. Those trends should also all be positive for AMZN stock

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/garmin-cinemark-netflix-apple-and-amazon-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day-cm1013364,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL - August 27, 2018 - Zacks Equity Research highlights Garmin Ltd. GRMN as the Bull of the Day, Cinemark Holdings CNK as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Netflix NFLX , Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN .

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day :

It has, at times, been difficult to put one's finger on the exact investing strategy which has had the most success this year, but in hindsight, it seems a combination of growth, income, and momentum has been successful. One stock that sports all three of these things-and makes quality consumer electronics-is Garmin Ltd .

Garmin is a pioneer of personal GPS navigation products, and it now also provides high-quality, fitness-forward wearable technology devices. The company serves five primary businesses: automotive, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor recreation. This means Garmin has exposure to exciting growth opportunities and legacy tech markets, and it stands as a leader in both.

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock pays a dividend, has generated strong momentum over the past several months, and is poised for near-term and long-term earnings growth.

Earnings and Outlook

In its most recent quarter, Garmin reported earnings of 68 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a healthy 12 cents and improving 31% year over year. The firm also posted better-than-expected revenue of $710.9 million, which was up nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter.

More importantly, Garmin once again displayed a healthy balance sheet. The company generated cash flow from operating activities in excess of $214 million. It has no long-term debt, and its cash and equivalents now total $1.07 billion.

Garmin's positive results and upbeat outlook have since inspired a number of positive earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank is fundamentally based on these estimates and revisions, so this positive trend explains Garmin's #1 (Strong Buy) designation. However, there are other reasons to be optimistic about this stock right now.

Bear of the Day :

A healthy consumer economy should breed plenty of great opportunities to invest in companies which serve consumers, especially in the discretionary and leisure markets. That has been the case over the past few years, but we have had some underperforming stragglers, too. One such example is Cinemark Holdings .

Cinemark is a major movie theater owner and operator, sporting a portfolio of more than 500 locations and nearly 6,000 screens. It is one of the largest movie theater companies in the world and holds a strong share of the U.S. and Latin American markets.

We are nearing the end of summer blockbuster season, and all in all, it has been a decent stretch for Hollywood. After summer revenue hit its lowest level in two decades last year, movies bounced back with year-over-year sales box office growth of nearly 13%.

A nice mix of superhero movies, the resurgence of documentaries, and films which featured unprecedented on-screen representation resonated with audiences, and the industry comfortably recovered from what has a horrible last year.

And that's what makes Cinemark's recent performance concerning. Just a few weeks ago, the company posted quarterly earnings of 70 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. That figure was still a noticeable improvement from the year-ago period, but with revenue also coming in below expectations, we were left to wonder why Cinemark was unable to capitalize on improve box office numbers.

The summer movie season crosses into two fiscal periods for most movie theater companies, but if recent earnings estimates and revisions are any indication, Cinemark could be ready to disappoint in its next earnings release as well.

The Zacks Rank is fundamentally based on these estimates and revisions, so this negative trend explains Cinemark's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) designation.

On top of that, there is not a particularly great earnings growth outlook for Cinemark right now. The company is expected to see its earnings contract nearly 12% on a year-over-year basis in the current fiscal year, and although the bottom-line is projected to rebound with growth of 11.5%, Cinemark would just be right back to where it was last year-a historically bad year for movies.

Buy Netflix (NFLX) Stock After International Expansion Upgrade?

Shares of Netflix surged over 4% Friday on the back of an analyst upgrade, which helped cap off a strong week for the streaming TV titan amid what had been a dismal post-earnings stretch. So let's take a look at the reasoning for the upgrade, along with some other Netflix news, before we see if it might be time to buy Netflix stock.

Upgrade

SunTrust analysts raised their rating for Netflix stock from ""hold"" to ""buy,"" citing the potential for impressive subscriber growth in the third quarter. ""The stock pullback post the 2Q subs miss (which we attribute to '13 Reasons Why' and World Cup, as previewed) leaves us with ~20% potential upside from current levels,"" analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

""More important, our India study shows NFLX initial original series resonating quite well with interest in NFLX rising (including relative to competitors) into more originals coming.""

The SunTrust analysts said that their firm's analysis of web search trends pointed to the possibility that Netflix can add 5 million international subscribers during Q3, which comes in well above Netflix's projection of 4.35 million. Thornton did lower his price target for Netflix from $415 per share to $410 per share. The slightly lower price target still represented about a 21% upside from NFLX's closing price of $339.17 on Thursday.

Recent News

On top of the SunTrust upgrade, investors might be pleased to note that Netflix is hoping to move away from paying Apple's app store tax. The streaming firm is currently testing a workaround that directs potential users to its mobile website when they try to sign up for Netflix in Apple's app store. The trial run is reportedly live in 33 countries, according to TechCrunch .

Apple takes a 30% cut of all subscription purchases made in its app right off the top every month. Meanwhile, Netflix is able to keep the whole monthly subscription fee if users sign up for its streaming service through its own website and log-in through the application later. Therefore, Netflix would be able to make a lot more money if it were able to bypass Apple's fees.

Netflix also began to test short ads for other NFLX content during the countdown period before the next episode of a show automatically starts to play. The idea for Netflix is to keep users engaged, and promoting new content seems like a logical step. ""We are testing whether surfacing recommendations between episodes helps members discover stories they will enjoy faster,"" Netflix wrote in a statement . ""It is important to note that a member is able to skip a video preview at any time if they are not interested.""

Overview

Netflix must walk a thin line in its experiments with ads even for its own content since many users joined to avoid unsolicited ads altogether. And one of the last things that Netflix should do is alienate some consumers even in the slightest way since the firm faces heightened competition.

Amazon is actively spending billions to improve its offerings on Amazon Prime, which includes not only big-budget action series but also indie films with A-list Hollywood stars-and sports content.

Time to Buy?

Shares of Netflix were cruising along until the company reported its second-quarter financial results, which on their face were strong. Revenues jumped 43% to hit $3.91 billion last quarter and earnings soared. But NFLX added 1 million fewer subscribers than it expected, which looked even worse since the firm had surpassed its own subscriber forecasts in seven out of the last nine periods, including massive beats in the trailing two quarters.

Reed Hastings' firm had seen its stock price sink roughly 12% since it reported its earnings in mid-July. Yet, Netflix's recent dip is a reason to consider buying shares of NFLX because it seems hard to think that the firm won't see its stock price climb back up as its growth story isn't over just yet-even if it looks a bit more uncertain these days.

Netflix closed the quarter with 130 million subscribers worldwide, which marked roughly 25% growth from the year-ago period's 104 million. Looking ahead, the company expects to add 5 million new subscribers during the third quarter, with 650,000 projected in the U.S. and 4.35 million internationally.

Plus, Netflix is projected to see its Q3 revenues surge by roughly 34% to reach $3.99 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, its adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket over 134% to $0.68 per share.

However, Netflix has received 15 downward earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year, against only two positive changes, within the last 60 days. Therefore, some investors will want to remain a bit more cautious about NFLX, while others might want to buy in on the dip.

R&D Spending Hits Fastest Pace in 12 Years: 5 Top Stocks

The U.S. economy suffered from a lack of big ideas for a while. But that's not the case now. There has been a surge in research and development (R&D) spending at corporate houses, particularly this year. It is a welcome change and indicates that companies are finally putting their money into innovative ideas to boost productivity, which has been lagging badly.

Research and development increases market participation, helps a company stay ahead of market trends and keep it relevant. Thus, investing in companies that have stepped up investments in R&D so far this year seems prudent.

Business Investments in Intellectual Property Rise

As per government and corporate data, several companies are pouring billions of dollars into R&D, thereby driving business investments in intellectual property at the fastest pace in 12 years. Per FactSet nearly 215 S&P 500 companies said that their R&D investments on a quarterly basis increased more than $19 billion to $140 billion in the first half of this year compared to the same period a year earlier. That's an annualized growth rate of around 33%.

Bureau of Economic Analysis also added that private-sector investments in intellectual property, which includes R&D, have grown at an annualized rate of 11.1% to $893 billion so far this year. This, in turn, contributed about 0.5% to the 3.1% annualized economic growth rate, their biggest contribution since 1999.

What Boosted Spending in R&D?

Most of the companies did have plenty of cash on hand, so availability of capital hasn't affected spending in R&D. Moreover, it's not the capital but the market opportunities that determine whether a company will in invest in R&D or not.

So, is it the recent corporate tax cuts that have got to do something with the spike in R&D? Sure, there is a possibility. Companies are currently capitalizing on the recent tax cut to increase their R&D expenditures, since the law requires amortization of R&D expenditures beginning in 2022.

Big Spenders in Intellectual Property

Big U.S. tech firms and pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in R&D. Of the S&P 500 companies that report R&D quarterly, the top spenders in their last two quarters are Amazon ($14.01 B), Alphabet ($10.15 B), Microsoft ($7.65 B), Apple ($7.08 B), Intel ($6.75 B), Merck ($5.35 B), Johnson & Johnson ($4.79 B), Facebook ($4.76 B), Bristol-Myers-Squibb ($3.65 B), Pfizer ($3.53), Celgene ($3.45 B), Cisco Systems ($3.22 B), Oracle ($3.04 B), Qualcomm ($2.81 B) and International Business Machines ($2.77 B), per FactSet.

Each of these companies is trying to maximize their market share for fast growing technologies including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and new generation drugs. Amazon, in particular, doesn't use the term 'research and development' but states 'technology and content' that includes outlays on equipment, property, software and artistic content.

Investments in R&D by automakers, aerospace, other industrial companies, energy, materials and chemicals are surely missing the list. However, we all know that a lot of investments are required for self-driving vehicles and renewable energy to name a few, which have the potential to transform our world in the next few decades. Fortunately, General Motors, Ford, Lockheed Martin, General Electric and Exxon Mobil do have a very large R&D budget, an encouraging sign indeed.

Why R&D Matters?

The research that we do at present will certainly lead to amazing goods and services of tomorrow. A high level of R&D invariably leads to higher productivity growth, which will eventually help the broader economy grow at 3% or more.

R&D, by the way, boosts the standard of living and labor productivity. This again bodes well for the economy. Remember, that the United States has invested more than $550 billion a year in R&D, nearly 25% of total global outlays. But China and several other Asian economies are catching up, with growth rates that are twice as high.

5 Top Players Worth Buying

Given the importance of R&D and the pace at which it has picked up, investing in stocks that are spending big on tomorrow's ideas is the best thing to do right now. Their innovative approach and the zeal to stay ahead of the pack will surely boost profit margins in the long run. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/faang-stocks-what-to-expect-in-the-second-half-cm1013287,"FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — continue to demolish the stock market, posting average year-to-date returns of 40%, compared to 7.5% rise for the S&P 500 index.

The collective outperformance of FAANGs come even as both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 logged all-time highs on Friday. And the fact that FAANG stocks account for just 12.8% of the S&P 500 makes it even more remarkable, dispelling the notion that FAANG is doing all the heavy lifting. That said, not all FAANGs have participated equally.

The phrase “If you live by the FAANGs, you die by the FAANGs” was magnified following the declines of both Netflix and Facebook following their earnings results. The latter, in particular, suffered a 19% tumble after warning investors that revenue growth will take a hit in the second half of the year. Facebook’s decline, which equated to one-fifth of its value ($120 in market cap), quickly spread to the other FAANG stocks.

The question is, can these tech titans maintain their “no-brainer” standing in the second half of the year, especially when analysts continue to warn that the ""long FAANG"" strategy is still the most-crowded trade on the market. In a recent investor note, Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, advised investors to short the FAANGs during the second half of 2018.

However, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson disagrees and he continues to expect the FAANG machine to power through. Only time will tell which investment strategy (long or short) wins out. But here’s a few company-specific factors investors should keep an eye on when making their decisions.

Facebook - Price $174.65 - Target $250 - Premium: 43%

Quick Take: Facebook guidance and slowing user growth spooked investors. In Q2 monthly active users (MAUs) rose to 228 million year over year basis and 38 million sequentially to 2.23 billion. However, the growth rate marked a significantly slowed down from Q1 when Facebook added 260 million users year over year and 67 million sequentially. Plus, the company’s says it expects expenses, particular in safety and security, to increase faster than revenues in 2019. Nevertheless, investors ignored the fact that advertising revenues soared 42.3% year over year to $13.04 billion. Thus, I see the decline as a solid buying opportunity.

Amazon - Price $1,905.39 - Target $2,150 - Premium: 13%

Quick Take: The e-commerce giant enjoyed 30% surge in net product sales in Q2, reaching $31.86 billion and driving overall Q2 revenues to $52.9 billion (up 40%). The company’s bread-and-butter AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud business, meanwhile, skyrocketed 49% to reach $6.12 billion, translating to a 12% sequential gain. All told, Amazon now owns 34% of the total cloud computing market as of the second quarter, according to Synergy Research Group. So, despite its 63% year-to-date stock gains, Amazon is showing no signs of slowing down.

Apple - Price $216.16 - Target $250 - Premium: 15.65%

Quick Take: Fears around weak iPhone X demand, prompting the market to take""wait-and-see"" approach, were once again surfacing, but those concerns turned out to be baseless. But following better-than-expected results, including revenue, profits and iPhone unit sales, Apple shares soared to all-time highs. Not only did Apple demonstrate strength in its Services segment (now 15% of revenue), the company's better-than-expected outlook drove Apple to a $1 trillion market cap. Despite this status, Apple is still arguably the cheapest stock on the market, when factoring its $253B in cash.

Netflix - Price $358.82 - Target $420 - Premium: 17%

Quick Take: Netflix’s Q2 results sent the stock falling some 10% as the company reports 670K domestic streaming additions, which not only missed consensus 1.21M, but also missed the company’s own guidance for 1.20M. International streaming additions were up 4.47M during the quarter, which was also short of the 5.06M analysts were looking for. It’s broadly understood, however, that the World Cup was a major factor in those results as the soccer spectacle, which draws billions of fans globally, stole the world’s attention from those who would otherwise stream content from Netflix. But the decline has made NFLX more attractive for who have waited for a better entry point.

Google - Price $1,236.75 - Target $1,450 - Premium: 17%

Quick Take: An impressive surge in paid clicks lead to an easy beat on both the top and bottom lines in the search giant’s Q2 results. Revenues grew 26% year over year, while operating income came in a $2 billion despite a hefty fine on EU. Excluding the fines, net income would have risen to $8.26B from $6.26B. The major story here, however, was the 58% Q2 surge in paid clicks, compared to a rise of just 15% in Q1. Ans with Cost-per-click falling 22% year over year and 10% sequentially, Google was able to dispel fears that profit margins would remain under pressure, suggesting it deserves more time to adjust its business to adapt to a changing regulatory landscape.",2018-08-27,Facebook

(RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. (AAPL) plans to launch three new iPhones soon that keep the edge-to-edge screen design of last year's flagship, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The devices will boast a wider range of prices, features and sizes to increase their appeal.

However, none of the three iPhones will be wholly new designs like the iPhone X was last year or the iPhone 6 in 2014, with some inside Apple labeling the launch as an ""S year,"" a designation the company has given to new handsets that retain the previous design but add new internal features. The company is planning more significant changes for next year, the report said.

The upcoming phones, planned to be unveiled in September, show the company is adjusting its strategy. Rather than luring millions of new iPhone users, Apple's goal these days is to steadily raise average prices, while expanding the total number of active devices to support sales of accessories and digital services like streaming music and video, the report said.

The three new iPhones due next month have a good chance to add to this important foundation of the company's future. There'll be a new high-end iPhone, internally dubbed D33, with a display that measures about 6.5-inch diagonally, the report said.

That would make it the largest iPhone by far and one of the biggest mainstream phones on the market. It will continue to have a glass back with stainless steel edges and dual cameras on the back. The big difference on the software side will be the ability to view content side-by-side in apps like Mail and Calendar. It will be Apple's second phone with a crisper organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen.

The report indicated that Apple also plans an upgrade to the current iPhone X with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, which is internally dubbed D32. The main changes to the new OLED iPhones will be to processing speed and the camera. Perhaps the most significant phone will be a new, cheaper device destined to replace the iPhone 8. Codenamed N84, it will look like the iPhone X, but include a larger near 6.1-inch screen, come in multiple colors, and sport aluminum edges instead of the iPhone X's stainless steel casing. It will also have a cheaper LCD screen instead of an OLED panel to keep costs down.

The cheaper version's aluminum edges won't necessarily be the same color as the colored glass back, simplifying production, the report said.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. will assemble the two high-end OLED iPhones, while the LCD phone will be split primarily between Hon Hai and Pegatron Corp., the people said. Hon Hai began assembling the OLED devices in late July and only started on the LCD phones this month, partly due to minor challenges with the LCD panels, the report said.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will remain sole supplier of the main processor for the new iPhones, while primary iPhone camera lens supplier Largan Precision Co. is expected to see sales rise with the launch of new Apple phones.All three will have the gesture-based control system Apple introduced last year to replace the iPhone home button. They will also feature Face ID, Apple's system for unlocking the phones by glancing at them. Bloomberg reportedseveral details of the new phones earlier this year.The lower-end device will be Apple's second attempt at differentiating its phones partly by color.

https://www.smarteranalyst.com/bloggers-corner/combination-tesla-tsla-apple-aapl-nothing-fairy-tale-twist/,"By Gene Munster

The roller coaster surrounding Elon Musk’s failed effort to take Tesla private resurfaced the topic of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) buying Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ).

) buying Tesla (NASDAQ: ). If Tesla successfully turns the corner to profitability, the combination of the two companies is nothing more than a fairy tale, as both companies would want to retain design control. Our bet is that Tesla is successful and reaches sustained profitability in a year.

The twist: If we’re wrong, and Tesla fails to reach profitability in the next year, Apple gains the upper hand and becomes the most likely investor or buyer. Both companies share a passion for hardware design, software, AI. Plus, Apple’s balance sheet makes the combination viable. Google is the next most likely acquirer. We don’t see a traditional automotive company as a potential acquirer, given they lack the cash needed to purchase Tesla even at a distressed valuation.

Given Apple’s and Google’s ambitions in autonomy, Tesla won’t go to zero, but a sale would likely be well below Tesla’s current $54B market cap. How much lower? It’s hard to say.

Let’s go over why it sounds so good: Outside of an outright acquisition, what if Apple simply made a $10 billion equity investment in Tesla instead? It sounds so good — Apple working with Tesla. In theory, it would make our lives so much better. Imagine all of the things you love about your iPhone, perfectly integrated with all the things Tesla owners rave about. The two tech giants could take over the auto industry over the next 20 years as consumers embrace electric vehicles and automation. From Telsa’s Perspective. Tesla would no longer have to be a public company. Tim Cook would be the steady hand, and Elon Musk would be the renewable energy visionary. A $10 billion cash infusion would all but eliminate any current or future cash problems for Tesla. While a $10 billion equity investment would cause ~20% dilution today, it would likely have a long-term benefit on Tesla’s stock given the removal of the cash question. We believe Apple could and would want to provide resources from their world-class hardware, software, and AI teams to make Teslas even better. The investment would likely remove Apple as a potential direct or indirect competitor in the autonomous vehicle space. Additionally, Tesla’s Model 3 could be showcased in Apple’s 511 retail stores in 21 countries. From Apple’s Perspective. Investors would feel that Apple is actually doing something with their cash, which would be a positive for the stock’s multiple. Apple would be investing in a company that has the potential to be multiple times bigger over the next decade. Apple would not be spending on the impossible, like building its own car to try to catch Tesla. Apple would be investing in making the leader even better. The impact of AI and robotics on the automotive sector is one of the next mega tech trends, and Apple would take the pole position.

Now, why an equity investment won’t happen:

Apple and Tesla are single product visionaries. Single product visionaries create world-class consumer products. Steve Jobs with Mac and iPhone, and Musk (even with his issues) with Tesla. These visionaries are able to build cultures that create great products. If you try to merge two unique cultures, you usually end up with mediocrity. If we as consumers want the best products, we should want Apple and Tesla to keep their cultures separate and do it their way, even if it means competing with each other in auto.

It’s hard to imagine Apple doing a deal without some deeper operational partnership or influence on the product, given their work in the auto sector. An investment in Tesla, an American automaker, has very different strategic implications than the investment in Didi Chuxing, a ride-sharing platform in China. Apple has a board seat at Didi and can exert some control; it’s hard to imagine Tesla management welcoming outside influence on their products when they already make the best car in the world.

Musk won’t let it happen, and more importantly, shouldn’t let it happen. There is a deal Tesla might accept, but Apple likely wouldn’t. Tesla might agree to a $10 billion cash investment from Apple if Apple were to accept non-voting shares and have no operational influence. Apple would essentially act as a silent equity investor. If Apple were to invest $10B and get voting shares, they would be the largest voting shareholder in the company, surpassing Elon Musk.

As has been popular with large Internet companies, Tesla could create a non-voting share class that would enable Musk to retain his position as the largest voting shareholder in the event of an Apple investment. While great in theory, we don’t see Apple agreeing to non-voting shares. Apple’s philosophy on the use of cash outside of repatriation has been to generate operational benefits. We believe Apple would want some influence on Tesla in order to feel confident they could generate operational benefits.

And why an outright sale won’t happen:

Tesla doesn’t want a sale to happen. People often ask why Apple doesn’t just buy Tesla outright. While Tesla doesn’t have dual-class stock arrangements like some other companies, it does have supermajority voting provisions that protect the company from “unsolicited acquisition attempts and hostile takeover initiatives.” The supermajority provision means an acquirer would need two-thirds of shareholders to vote for a change of control.

Elon Musk owns 21% of Tesla, so it would require 83% of the non-Musk shares to vote for the sale, which would be unlikely given shareholder and insider support for Musk. It’s fun to talk about Apple buying Tesla, but we don’t think Tesla is for sale.

It’s important to understand how much Musk loves Tesla. He’s endured quite a bit for the company recently. On a recent earnings call, he said, “I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever.” We believe Musk has a very long-term vision for Tesla and that money is not his primary motivation for that vision.

Apple is rebuilding its auto initiative

After scaling back Project Titian (Apple’s auto initiative) in 2016 and 2017, Apple appears to be rebuilding the team. Most notability, earlier this month Apple re-hired Doug Field from Tesla, where he was head of vehicle engineering and one of four top executives named in Tesla’s proxy. Additionally, CNBC reported last week that 46 people have left Tesla to join Apple since the beginning of 2018. We caution that the number may be misleading; we don’t know how many people left Apple to join Tesla in this same time span. Either way, it’s clear Apple has big ambitions in auto, but difficult to see what those ambitions will bring. We still don’t know if we will see an Apple-branded car, a ride-share fleet, or a partnership with an existing automaker.

By Brenda Goh

SHANGHAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China pledged on Monday to tighten oversight of its transport industry and warned that the country did not need ride-hailing firms which compromised on passenger safety, days after a Didi Chuxing passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.

The killing of a 20-year-old passenger who rode in the Didi vehicle on Friday in the eastern city of Wenzhou is the second such incident since May, denting the image of the Beijing-based company, which is the world's largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides and is expanding globally.

""If a company is not compliant and self-disciplined, and takes its passengers' lives as a game, the public will vote with their feet and the government will not just stand by,"" the transport ministry said in a commentary on its website.

The National Development and Reform Commission said that various government departments would push to improve overall governance of operators and would expand the use of a fledgling social credit system across the transport sector.

Didi declined to comment on Monday. It has suspended its Hitch carpooling service and previously said that it felt deeply responsible and would complete by Sept. 1 a new compliance operation to be inspected by the ministries and the public.

Police said a 27-year-old driver named Zhong was detained at about 4 a.m. on Saturday and confessed to raping and killing the passenger, who had used the Hitch service to book her trip. Her body was dumped over a guardrail and down a cliff, police said.

Didi said the suspect had no criminal record, had provided authentic documentation and passed a facial recognition test before starting work.

However, it also said it failed to act on a complaint made against the driver on Thursday by a passenger who alleged the driver took her to a remote place and followed her after she got out of the car.

CHANGES DEMANDED

Authorities in Shenzhen told Didi's local subsidiary to make improvements to its service by the end of September, the official People's Daily reported.

Shenzhen's traffic bureau said that if Didi did not comply with the requirements, the city could revoke the company's local business license and require it to stop offering internet services in Shenzhen.

China has more than 80 companies that hold licenses to compete in the ride-hailing sector, the transport ministry said last week.

Didi's backers include Japan'sSoftBank Group Corp, Apple Inc and U.S-based ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies, whose China business Didi acquired in 2016, making Didi the dominant operator in the world's most populous country.

Didi, which was valued at $56 billion in a fundraising round last year, has been expanding into overseas markets including Australia and Mexico, going head-to-head with Uber. The company has also prepared for an initial public offering as soon as this year, according to people familiar with its plans.

Didi says it makes 30 million trips a day, with more than 30 million drivers on its platform. It offers 14 services including Hitch, which allows users to hail a car via their smartphone and share a ride with someone headed in the same direction. Didi said Hitch has run more than 1 billion trips in the past three years.

Two lawsuits were filed in courts in Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces last year against Didi Hitch drivers by passengers who said the drivers had raped or assaulted them, according to court documents. One driver was sentenced to 10 months in prison, while the other received a sentence of 3.5 years.

After a 21-year-old flight attendant was murdered in May, allegedly by her Didi Hitch driver, the company took steps including limiting the hours during which carpool drivers can pick up passengers of the opposite sex, and testing an ""escort mode"" on its app enabling passengers to share their routes and destinations with emergency contacts.

The latest killing has been one of the most discussed topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo service since the weekend, with Didi's official apology post gaining more than 500,000 comments.

Some comments were critical of Didi's outsourcing of some customer service functions in some cities, after a series of media reports focused on that. Didi said the incident had revealed many deficiencies with its customer service processes.

Reuters found advertisements on job portals dating as far back as 2014 from third-party companies seeking customer service personnel for Didi in cities such as Beijing, Hefei and Chengdu offering salaries starting from about 3,000 yuan($436.43) a month.

Many social media users said that they wanted to see major changes being made and that public trust was being eroded as it was not the first incident.

""I don't dare to use Didi in the future,"" one said.

Didi rival AutoNavi Maps suspended its carpooling service on Monday saying that it was doing so out of concern for ""passenger safety"". It declined to comment on whether the decision was related to the Didi case.

Murder of Didi passenger prompts China clampdown, outrage

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/this-marijuana-retailer-beats-apple-and-tiffany-on-1-key-sales-metric-cm1013175,"One of the most important metrics used in evaluating the success of retailers is revenue per square foot. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reigned as the top retailer in the world last year with $5,546 in revenue per square foot, according to market research company eMarketer. Jewelry store chain Tiffany & Co. was also high on the list with sales of $2,951 per square foot.

But there's now a surprising new winner in this key sales metric. Marijuana retailer MedMen Enterprises (NASDAQOTH: MMNFF) recently reported revenue per square foot of $6,541 at its seven cannabis stores operating in California. And MedMen is just getting started.

Image source: Getty Images.

Is it just the novelty of legal weed?

Apple's entrance into the retail market years ago was so revolutionary that the Apple Store was viewed by some as ""the future of retail."" The technology company succeeded by innovating in ways that other retailers hadn't. Is MedMen now the new future of retail?

Some might scoff at the idea. They could suggest that MedMen is merely benefiting from the novelty of consumers in California legally buying marijuana in retail stores. After all, the state didn't allow the legal use and sale of recreational marijuana until January 2018.

However, MedMen's preliminary numbers for its quarter ending June 30, 2018, appear to point to more than just novelty accounting for its success. The company reported that its seven locations that were in operation throughout the entire quarter saw 94,000 new customers but also had nearly 130,000 returning customers.

Perhaps even more striking, though, is the comparison of MedMen's performance against other cannabis retailers in California. There are more than 400 licensed marijuana dispensaries in the state. MedMen's seven stores make up less than 2% of the total number of retail marijuana locations. But those seven stores generated around 6% of total legal sales of marijuana and related products in California in the last quarter, based on tax revenue data released by the state. MedMen's stores generate roughly three times more revenue on average than stores operated by rivals.

I think that much of MedMen's success stems from its adherence to the old retailing maxim: location, location, location. MedMen operates six retail cannabis stores in the Los Angeles area, with one in Beverly Hills, one in downtown L.A., another in West Hollywood, a very strategically placed outlet at the LAX airport, and two stores at Venice Beach (one of which just opened in June). In addition, MedMen has one store in Santa Ana and another in San Diego.

The company hasn't reported sales statistics for its retail locations in other states. MedMen opened its first branded store in Las Vegas in July and plans to relocate an existing marijuana dispensary from North Las Vegas to near the city's main airport. The company also operates four medical cannabis dispensaries in New York.

More stores on the way

Growth in the California market is a major reason why U.S. sales of marijuana are expected to soar to $22 billion by 2022 . MedMen's primary focus on California makes a lot of sense. However, the company also plans to move into other markets.

MedMen is looking to open recreational marijuana retail locations in Massachusetts. Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics project that the state's marijuana market will grow from $151 million last year to over $1.2 billion by 2022.

The company also plans to expand in Florida, which allows the legal use of medical marijuana but hasn't legalized recreational marijuana. Even without recreational marijuana sales, Florida is expected to become the third-biggest cannabis market in the U.S. within the next four years, with more than $1.7 billion spent on marijuana.

MedMen has gone international as well. The company is teaming up with Cronos Group , one of the top marijuana growers in Canada, to develop branded cannabis products and launch retail stores throughout Canada.

In addition, MedMen is integrating vertically by building its own production facilities. The company recently opened a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Nevada. It's copying this facility's layout to construct a new facility in California that's expected to be ready for operations early next year. MedMen's plan is to replicate these facilities in New York and potentially in Florida.

One not-so-appealing metric

It's certainly a feather in the cap for MedMen to beat accomplished retailers like Apple and Tiffany in revenue generated per square foot. However, it's still early. MedMen's results were for only one quarter.

There's also one not-so-appealing metric about MedMen that investors should know about. The stock trades at nearly 120 times sales. Granted, this valuation measure doesn't reflect MedMen's strong revenue growth that has yet to be officially reported for its quarter ending June 30, 2018. Even if we included the company's preliminary revenue figure, though, the stock would still be ridiculously expensive.

Despite its retail success in California, MedMen's stock performance has been lackluster so far this year. While MedMen could be a huge winner as the U.S. and Canadian marijuana markets expand, my view is that shoppers for stocks might want to look elsewhere for now.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/netflix-doesnt-want-to-pay-apples-app-store-tax-anymore-cm1013139,"Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) recently started testing a feature that directs subscribers to a separate browser window to process their payments on iOS. That move prevents Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) from taking a cut of the payment through its App Store.

Apple currently takes a 30% cut of a user's first subscription and a 15% cut on future renewals. With Netflix ranking as the third-highest grossing app in the App Store, the new feature could take a serious bite out of Apple's growing services business.

Image source: Apple.

Netflix is testing the feature in 33 countries across Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This move isn't surprising, since it could boost Netflix's revenue per subscriber and widen its moat against Apple, which is evolving into a streaming video competitor with its growing portfolio of original content.

However, this move also highlights a vulnerability in the app store business model that could cause headaches for Apple and similarly Alphabet' s Google.

A growing revolt against mobile app stores

Netflix isn't the first company to revolt against OS-based app store fees. Back in 2015, Spotify offered subscribers cheaper prices on its website than the rates on its iOS app. Chinese tech giant Tencent hosts a growing number of ""mini programs"" in its WeChat mobile messaging app -- which bypass app store fees because they're downloaded from inside the app.

Earlier this year, Tencent-backed Epic Games launched Fortnite for Android through a downloadable APK (application package) on its website instead of the Google Play Store. Research firm Sensor Tower estimates that Epic's decision could cost Google over $50 million in lost revenue this year.

To top it all off, Apple faces an ongoing lawsuit from developers who claim that the company abuses the App Store's dominant position to take an unfair cut of developers' revenue. The Supreme Court is expected to eventually rule on the case.

How badly could these moves hurt Apple?

Apple and Google both lowered their second-year app subscription fees from 30% to 15% last year in response to those complaints. Yet those reduced rates probably won't prevent heavyweight players like Netflix and Spotify from redirecting subscribers to their websites for sign-ups.

Image source: Apple.

Earlier this year, Apple announced that the App Store generated $26.5 billion in revenue for developers in 2017, representing about 30% growth from 2016. Based on that 30% cut, Apple generated as much as $11.5 billion from the App Store for the year -- which would account for 5% of its top line.

Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter expects Apple to generate $20 billion in annual App Store revenue in 2020 , which would equal a quarter of its net earnings. If pressure from major companies or app developers forces Apple to slash its standard rate to 15%, for example, that figure would be cut in half. Schachter thinks Apple could potentially lower its cut to 5% to 15%, and as a result, it'd lose up to $16 billion annually in the worst-case scenario.

But let's not overreact

Those estimates look ugly, but investors should remember three key things. First, only major companies like Netflix and Spotify can afford to thumb their nose at Apple or Google. Smaller developers who lack the brand recognition still need the App Store's support.

Second, Apple is already fighting back against subscription-based services with first-party platforms like Apple Music. Apple is spending a lot of money on original video content, and it's widely expected to launch a Netflix competitor in the near future.

Those services have the potential to hurt Spotify and Netflix, while further boosting services revenue, which rose 31% annually last quarter and accounted for 18% of sales. The growth of those subscription services, along with other services like Apple Pay and AppleCare, will serve to reduce the weight of the App Store within the segment.

Lastly, developers can't ask customers to download and install iOS apps from third-party websites, as Epic did with Fortnite for Android, since Apple only allows app installations from the App Store. Therefore, only subscription-based apps are currently vulnerable to pop-up payment windows.

The key takeaways

Netflix's decision to redirect payments is clever, but it won't cripple the App Store model. Apple faces pressure to lower its fees, but most developers cannot afford to pull their apps off iOS. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on this story, but they really shouldn't fret about its impact on Apple's long-term growth.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/apples-new-mac-mini-strategy-revealed-cm1013112,"The last time Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) updated its Mac mini desktop computer lineup was in October 2014. The systems are, unsurprisingly, extremely outdated.

Although it started to look as though Apple was simply going to let this product category wither away and die, Apple CEO Tim Cook, in response to an email from a MacRumors reader, said, ""We do plan for Mac mini to be an important part of our product line going forward.""

Image source: Apple.

It's been almost a year since Cook's October 2017 email response was published, but Apple has yet to announce updated Mac minis. However, thanks to reporting from Bloomberg, we know that updates are coming shortly.

What we know so far

Apple's planning to release upgraded Mac mini systems later this year, according to Bloomberg . The updated models will reportedly be targeted toward ""pro users"" (Bloomberg says that the Mac mini is ""popular with app developers, those running home media centers, and server farm managers"").

""New storage and processor options are likely to make [the new Mac minis] more expensive than previous versions,"" Bloomberg reports.

Let's take a look at what upgrades Apple might bring to the new systems.

A huge jump in processor capability

All of Apple's Mac Mini systems come with Intel 's (NASDAQ: INTC) fourth-generation Core processors. The lowest-end Mac mini comes configured with processors rated at a 15-watt thermal design power (TDP), while the higher-end configurations are equipped with more powerful (and more power-hungry) chips rated at a 28 watt TDP.

Earlier this year, Intel launched eighth-generation Core processors that are rated at a 28-watt TDP, making them suitable for the upgraded Mac mini. In the table below, I've included key specifications of the top fourth-generation Core processor that the Mac mini can be configured with as well as the specifications of its top eighth-generation Core counterpart.

Processor Core i7-4578U Core i7-8559U # of cores 2 4 # of threads 4 8 Processor base frequency 3.00GHz 2.7GHz Max turbo frequency 3.5GHz 4.5GHz Max memory size 16GB 32GB Max memory bandwidth 25.6GB/s 37.5GB/s Graphics Iris Graphics 5100 Iris Plus Graphics 655 eDRAM N/A 128MB

Source: Intel ARK.

In terms of performance, the difference between the current top-of-the-line Mac mini processor and the latest 28-watt processors is night and day. CPU performance has improved dramatically thanks to a combination of faster processor cores and having twice as many of them on the same chip. Graphics performance should be up substantially as well.

On top of the performance improvements, the latest processor supports up to 32GB of memory, up from 16GB in the processor that currently powers the Mac mini.

The current Mac mini supports Thunderbolt 2 connectivity -- a technology that was replaced by the much more capable Thunderbolt 3 in 2015. I'd expect that the refreshed Mac mini will gain Thunderbolt 3 support.

Impact to Apple's Mac business

Apple doesn't break down Mac revenue by product line, but it stands to reason that the current Mac mini is not a huge part of the company's Mac shipments.

Nevertheless, as long as Apple prices these refreshed machines appropriately, their long-awaited release should help drive Apple's Mac unit shipments and, ultimately, revenues up. If Bloomberg is right that ""new storage and processor options are likely to make it more expensive than previous versions,"" then the new Mac mini systems could have a positive impact on Apple's Mac average selling prices , too.

One thing Apple needs to do, however, is commit to a regular (and much faster) Mac mini release schedule to keep sales of the device healthy over time. Ideally, Apple should update the Mac mini with new processors roughly every year (Intel has publicly committed to launching new PC processors annually).

After all, if Apple's goal is to appeal to ""pro"" users -- that is, users that often value performance and features more than typical consumers do -- then it needs to keep the systems packed with modern hardware.

Time will tell whether Apple decides to stick with the Mac mini for the long term or if the update that's reportedly coming later this year will be the last one for a while.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-netflix-inc-stock-jumped-58-higher-today-cm1012961,"What happened

Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) rose as much as 5.8% on Friday, driven by a rosy analyst note. The streaming video veteran's stock reached this peak near 2:20 p.m. EDT.

So what

Analyst Matthew Thornton from SunTrust's financial advisory arm upgraded Netflix to a ""Buy"" today, even as he reduced the stock's target price from $415 to $410 per share. Thornton's checks indicate that the disappointing subscriber additions in the second quarter may have been related to the soccer World Cup taking eyeballs away from Netflix and other entertainment providers. The firm's research shows subscribers flocking back to non-soccer services, including Netflix, after the event's closing ceremony.

Now what

Thornton says that the Indian market is embracing Netflix's original content, giving the company a foot in the door in the world's second-largest consumer market. Netflix's willingness to experiment with cutting Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) out of its billing processes and raising prices in Japan also shows Thornton that the business probably is performing well -- any sane management team would stay away from these risky moves if subscriber additions weren't showing a healthy trend.

Share prices have now bounced 13% above their recent lows over the last week but remain 16% below July's all-time highs. Netflix's stock is also trading 13% below SunTrust's reduced target price.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/should-you-buy-these-5-millennial-backed-retail-stocks-cm1013055,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Like previous generations before them, the millennial generation has redefined American retailing. Born between 1981 and 1996, most are children of baby boomers. As such, this generation has become both sizable and influential. This affects the retail industry which serves it, and this has already begun to affect retail stocks to buy.

The stocks of companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) find themselves trading at higher price-earnings (P/E) ratios, due in no small part to their millennial appeal.

While this generation may have rebelled against their baby-boomer parents in some respects, baby boomers established and grew many of these companies.

Now that they have handed the baton to their millennial children, millennial tastes now redefine stores created by previous generations. These five retail stocks to buy enjoy widespread millennial support, yet also trade at levels that would appeal to investors.

Millennial Retail Stocks to Buy: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Most define Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as a brand, or a line of products, rather than a store. That remains true, but it's of the retail stocks to buy by virtue of operating 503 stores throughout the world, including 272 in the United States.

While many stores at the mall will appear to have more employees than customers, Apple stores seem overrun. Many of these customers hail from the millennial generation. According to Fortune , no other brand ranks higher in emotional attachment than Apple. Through devices such as iPhone, they connect with favorite millennial brands like Amazon. They can also run popular Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) apps, such as Google or YouTube.

Despite this appeal, AAPL stock will attract millennial grandparents such as Warren Buffett, one of its more prominent investors. AAPL stock maintains a P/E ratio of around 19.5. Analysts also expect average annual growth of about 13% over the next five years. Still, with its market cap exceeding $1 trillion, it will hold more appeal to those wanting to preserve rather than grow wealth at outsized rates.

Many will want a conservative investment offering growth bolstered by millennials. For this purpose, few retail stocks to buy will serve as a better choice than AAPL stock.

Millennial Retail Stocks to Buy: Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR)

Although a vibrant job market now blesses some millennials, many live with their parents and find themselves mired in student loan debt.

Even among millennials who can afford more affluent lifestyles, many prefer to spend the minimum on necessities to leave more money available for the experiences they cherish. Both trends lead millennials into stores such as Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR ) to provide life's necessities at lower prices.

With its acquisition of Family Dollar , the company now operates about 14,800 stores in the United States. It also runs just over 200 Dollar Tree stores across Canada. This makes it almost as large as Dollar General (NYSE: DG ), its primary rival.

At around $94 per share, investors will not find DLTR stock at a dollar store. Still, they will like the reasonable valuation. DLTR currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17. Moreover, analysts expect to see net income grow by an average of 13.6% per year over the next five years.

DG stock and DLTR stock closely match one another. Both stocks trade at about the same PE and closely match one another on growth rates. However, Dollar Tree has ranked higher among millennials. Also, with Family Dollar in the fold, the company captures those looking for the lowest price (Dollar Tree) and those willing to pay higher nominal prices for more product (Family Dollar).

Considering the appeal to both millennial customers and investors, Dollar Tree had stood out among retail stocks to buy for millennial-focused investing.

Millennial Retail Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD)

Our own Aaron Levitt describedHome Depot (NYSE: HD ) and millennials as ""a match made in heaven."" While I might not personally go that far, the company has indeed become one of the better retail stocks to buy because of a focus on millennials.

Home Depot has responded by offering online videos and in-store workshops on tools they did not learn to use in younger years. As a result, the company now credits much of its sales growth to customers in the millennial age group.

Also, millennials may not have as much trouble affording a home as some people believe. According to a survey by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), millennials now enjoy a 40% homeownership rate . Moreover, most do not live in urban areas. This would place them closer to where more Home Depot stores are located. As a result of their efforts and improving trends, Home Depot ranks as their top choice for home improvement over archrival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW ).

HD stock also happens to trade at a favorable valuation for investors. The stock stands at a forward PE of about 21. Analysts also expect an average annual growth rate of around 14.9% per year over the next five years. The stock's dividend yield of around 2.05% comes in slightly higher than current S&P 500 averages.

However, the dividend has increased every year since 2010. With these consistent dividend hikes, HD stock could provide a substantial payout in the coming years to long-term investors.

Admittedly, Lowe's financials closely match Home Depot. However, as long as Home Depot holds the greater appeal to millennials, I think the advantage goes to HD stock.

Millennial Retail Stocks to Buy: Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)

Source: Shutterstock

Another company that ranks near the top with regards to millennial emotional appeal is Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). Millennials also became the first generation to grow up with a Starbucks on every corner. As a result, they grew up with more coffee and more varieties of coffee than previous generations.

Moreover, as more activities moved to online platforms, Starbucks gained appeal as a place to meet in person. Starbucks reinforces this appeal through marketing via social media and ""speaking their language.""

This allure also extends to SBUX stock as it stands out with millennials as one of the great retail stocks to buy. The stock has struggled this year. Still, Robinhood, a trading app frequently used by millennials, shows that this generation continues to open positions in SBUX stock.

They may see a lucrative opportunity. Range-bound trading has defined SBUX stock for the last three years. As a result, their P/E has fallen to about 21.8. The stock has not traded at a valuation this low for many years. Profit growth will also remain in the double digits, with average growth of 13.9% per year expected for the next five years. Also, its dividend, which began in 2010, has increased every year since inception. It has risen to $1.44 per share, a yield of almost 2.75%.

With store growth reaching a saturation point in the United States, offshore markets, particularly China, will drive the future of SBUX stock. Domestic stores still need to increase same-store sales to remain viable. Most of that increase will likely come from the millennial generation.

With that, the millennial connection will help boost SBUX stock for years to come.

Millennial Retail Stocks to Buy: Target Corporation (TGT)

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)

Contrary to popular belief, two-thirds of millennials shop in stores on a weekly basis. Among general merchandise stores, they prefer Target (NYSE: TGT ) more than any other store. One survey ranked Target the 4th most popular brand among millennials earlier this year. This comes in higher than Walmart, and interestingly, e-commerce giant Amazon.

The company has lived up to its name regarding its recent focus on millennials. They phased out some old brands in favor of new lines of clothing and home goods. As millennials tend to prefer unique offerings, these private label brands such as Goodfellow & Co. and A New Day will bring customers into stores, or at least onto Target's website.

Like other brick-and-mortar retailers, they have also expanded online offerings and introduced in-store pickup. In an attempt to revamp grocery offerings, the company has focused on offering more organic, natural, and gluten-free items.

Among retail stocks to buy, TGT stock also provides an opportunity for investors. It has moved higher from 2017 levels when most seemed to fear an Amazon retail takeover. Despite substantial increases from year-ago levels, TGT stock trades at 16.3 times forward earnings. Thanks in large part to online sales, Wall Street predicts 13.4% growth this year. They also believe growth will average 7.5% per year over the next five years.

Also, the dividend recently went up to 64 cents per share per quarter. This payout, which has increased every year since 1972, yields over 2.9%. The continued profit growth should assure investors that this long-time dividend streak will not fall anytime soon.

With the revamped product lines and the attempts to combine online and in-store shopping options, Target should continue to win over a new generation of shoppers. Moreover, the low valuation and the increasing dividend should also boost TGT stock. Given these factors, Target should continue to increase its popularity with millennials and investors alike.

WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc'schief executive will testify before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on Sept. 5, the panel said on Friday, after some Republicans raised concerns about social media companies removing content from conservatives.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee ""intends to ask tough questions about how Twitter monitors and polices content,"" Republican Representative Greg Walden, the panel's chairman, said in a statement.

""We look forward to Mr. Dorsey being forthright and transparent regarding the complex processes behind the company's algorithms and content judgment calls,"" Walden said.

""Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, not mentioning any specific companies.

Trump also criticized social media outlets last week, saying without providing proof that unidentified companies were ""totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices.""

Those tweets followed actions taken by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc'sYouTube to remove some content posted by Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

Jones' Twitter account was temporarily suspended on Aug. 15.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/buy-netflix-nflx-stock-after-international-expansion-upgrade-cm1012915,"Shares of Netflix NFLX surged over 4% Friday on the back of an analyst upgrade, which helped cap off a strong week for the streaming TV titan amid what had been a dismal post-earnings stretch. So let's take a look at the reasoning for the upgrade, along with some other Netflix news, before we see if it might be time to buy Netflix stock.

Upgrade

SunTrust analysts raised their rating for Netflix stock from ""hold"" to ""buy,"" citing the potential for impressive subscriber growth in the third quarter. ""The stock pullback post the 2Q subs miss (which we attribute to '13 Reasons Why' and World Cup, as previewed) leaves us with ~20% potential upside from current levels,"" analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

""More important, our India study shows NFLX initial original series resonating quite well with interest in NFLX rising (including relative to competitors) into more originals coming.""

The SunTrust analysts said that their firm's analysis of web search trends pointed to the possibility that Netflix can add 5 million international subscribers during Q3, which comes in well above Netflix's projection of 4.35 million. Thornton did lower his price target for Netflix from $415 per share to $410 per share. The slightly lower price target still represented about a 21% upside from NFLX's closing price of $339.17 on Thursday.

Recent News

On top of the SunTrust upgrade, investors might be pleased to note that Netflix is hoping to move away from paying Apple's AAPL app store tax. The streaming firm is currently testing a workaround that directs potential users to its mobile website when they try to sign up for Netflix in Apple's app store. The trial run is reportedly live in 33 countries, according to TechCrunch .

Apple takes a 30% cut of all subscription purchases made in its app right off the top every month. Meanwhile, Netflix is able to keep the whole monthly subscription fee if users sign up for its streaming service through its own website and log-in through the application later. Therefore, Netflix would be able to make a lot more money if it were able to bypass Apple's fees.

Netflix also began to test short ads for other NFLX content during the countdown period before the next episode of a show automatically starts to play. The idea for Netflix is to keep users engaged, and promoting new content seems like a logical step. ""We are testing whether surfacing recommendations between episodes helps members discover stories they will enjoy faster,"" Netflix wrote in a statement . ""It is important to note that a member is able to skip a video preview at any time if they are not interested.""

Overview

Netflix must walk a thin line in its experiments with ads even for its own content since many users joined to avoid unsolicited ads altogether. And one of the last things that Netflix should do is alienate some consumers even in the slightest way since the firm faces heightened competition.

Amazon AMZN is actively spending billions to improve its offerings on Amazon Prime, which includes not only big-budget action series but also indie films with A-list Hollywood stars-and sports content. Plus, Disney DIS is ready to launch its stand-alone streaming service in late 2019, with Apple set to dive into streaming TV as well.

Time to Buy?

Shares of Netflix were cruising along until the company reported its second-quarter financial results, which on their face were strong. Revenues jumped 43% to hit $3.91 billion last quarter and earnings soared. But NFLX added 1 million fewer subscribers than it expected, which looked even worse since the firm had surpassed its own subscriber forecasts in seven out of the last nine periods, including massive beats in the trailing two quarters.

Reed Hastings' firm had seen its stock price sink roughly 12% since it reported its earnings in mid-July. Yet, Netflix's recent dip is a reason to consider buying shares of NFLX because it seems hard to think that the firm won't see its stock price climb back up as its growth story isn't over just yet-even if it looks a bit more uncertain these days.

Netflix closed the quarter with 130 million subscribers worldwide, which marked roughly 25% growth from the year-ago period's 104 million. Looking ahead, the company expects to add 5 million new subscribers during the third quarter, with 650,000 projected in the U.S. and 4.35 million internationally.

Plus, Netflix is projected to see its Q3 revenues surge by roughly 34% to reach $3.99 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, its adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket over 134% to $0.68 per share.

However, Netflix has received 15 downward earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year, against only two positive changes, within the last 60 days. Therefore, some investors will want to remain a bit more cautious about NFLX, while others might want to buy in on the dip.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazon-stock-cant-go-much-highercan-it-cm1013032,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I've been as big a bull on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as pretty much anyone over the past couple of years - and even I can't believe how far AMZN stock has run.

So far this year, AMZN has gained about 61%. It has added an incredible $348 billion in market capitalization in less than eight months. As I wrote last week, to put that figure in perspective, that $348B is nearly the entire market cap of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), the 11th most valuable company that's traded on U.S. markets.

It's a stunning move. It's stunning even given that I argued last year that Amazon would become the world's most valuable company . Certainly, I didn't expect Amazon to challenge for that title so soon; its market cap now is about 10% below that of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the world's first trillion-dollar company .

Even with a ton of good news, it's easy to wonder if AMZN stock isn't due for a breather of some sort. The valuation of AMZN stock is high, even though, as I've long argued, investors need to look beyond just the price-earnings multiple when valuing AMZN. The gains have been enormous. And even with a ton of good news so far in 2018, I have to wonder just how much steam is left in the AMZN rally.

Can AMZN Stock Correct?

A long-term chart of AMZN stock (see below) seems to show a stock that has simply moved directly higher for the past decade.

AMZN data by YCharts

But there have been some corrections along the way. AMZN stock lost about 25% of its value from its October 2011 peaks to its lows in December of that year. It dropped by about 25% in the first ten months of 2014. In the market correction of early 2016, AMZN stock declined almost 30% in less than two months.

Even this year, AMZN stock struggled for a brief spell when President Trump took aim at the company . The stock fell 15% in less than a month.

And this is a dearly valued company. The high price-earnings multiple can be explained by its thin margins and the billions of dollars that the giant invests in its businesses. Still, that's an easier story to buy in a market at all-time highs rather than one full of nervous investors. Whether it's a broad market correction, or just a growing sentiment that Amazon stock has gone too far, too fast, history shows that AMZN can pull back sharply and quickly.

Will AMZN Stock Correct?

Of course, every one of those pullbacks has proven to be a buying opportunity. And even at the current valuation, the simplest strategy seems to be to stay long or go long.

After all, the Amazon story seems to get stronger every month. Its Q2 earnings crushed expectations - and showed the company's ability to grow its profits even while it's investing a great deal in an effort to build future businesses. Amazon's advertising enterprise has gone from a potentially high-margin niche business to a huge part of the bull case. Online advertising kingpins Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , GOOG ) are very much at risk , as Brad Moon argued last month.

Amazon Web Services is still dominant in the cloud. The integration of Whole Foods appears to be progressing. Echo and Alexa are in the early stages of growth. And the legacy e-commerce business is showing no signs of slowing down. The fact that Amazon's revenue is still growing 20%+ annually on an organic basis is something close to incredible.

A correction in AMZN stock that's worth waiting for won't occur unless the story breaks down somehow. Either the market as a whole needs to correct or competitive fears have to creep into the Amazon story. And there is one potential competitor that could trigger such fears.

How Big a Threat Is Walmart (Again)?

The only real competitor to Amazon at this point is Walmart (NYSE: WMT ). And for a while, investors and analysts were arguing that the brick-and-mortar giant was becoming a worthy adversary. That argument seemed to have been refuted after Walmart plunged following its Q1 earnings. But the giant retailer's Q2 beat reinforced confidence in Walmart's omnichannel strategy. WMT stock subsequently soared, although it has pulled back lately.

As solid as Walmart's performance has been of late, I'm skeptical about its ability to really compete with Amazon. The companies can certainly coexist; Amazon isn't going to put Walmart out of business. But Amazon has spent two-plus decades growing around and through competition from Walmart - and everyone else.

So what, then, could undercut the AMZN rally? Other than a market correction - or at least a shift from growth stocks to value stocks - it's hard to see a stumbling block. That, in turn, means that AMZN very well may have a path to becoming the second trillion-dollar company, even if it 'feels' like the run has to end at some point.

Box (NYSE: BOX ) is a cloud company that doesn't trade like a cloud company.

It's also a good example of making lemons from lemonade.

Box was founded in 2005, at the dawn of cloud, and positioned itself as a consumer service. Within a few years, however, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and its rivals were giving away gigabytes of space free to consumers, almost more than they wanted.

So, Box evolved. It now positions itself as a content management company, a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for collaboration, process automation, and the creation of custom data protection, security and compliance features.

This has won Box corporate business and helped it integrate with smaller cloud players like ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW ). Techcrunch calls it an ""enterprise cloud stalwart.""

What it hasn't done is make BOX stock's post-IPO shareholders a ton of money.

Founder In a Box

Since Box went public in early 2015 with initial trades over $24 per share, BOX stock has fallen to below $11 per share and, in the last two years, more than doubled from that price as its new business model has taken hold.

Box stock is due to report earnings August 28, with analysts expecting a loss of 5 cents per share on revenue of $146.2 million. The loss is forgiven because Box is growing, the top line nearly doubling from 2015 to 2017, and the company is now on pace to achieve nearly $600 million in revenue by the end of its fiscal year in January, twice what it did in 2016.

This is rebuilding the reputation of Aaron Levie, who co-founded Box with Dylan Smith as a college business project at USC when he was just 20 and acted as corporate spokesman on TV for the next decade. Now 32, Levie's former ""house of horrors"" has a market cap of $3.6 billion.

Levie was made "" rich, but not Silicon Valley rich "" by the Box Stock IPO. He has since shown serious operating chops in reinventing the company, bringing in managers like Stephanie Carullo from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as chief operating officer .

Analysts have turned around, too. Of the 13 now following the company 8 have it rated as a buy . Typical is D.A. Davidson analyst Rishal Jaluria, who initiated coverage in February with a price target of $25 , which the company has now exceeded.

When a stock makes an analyst look good, they come back.

Box Today

Levie isn't invited on TV as much as he once was, and there are younger entrepreneurs to follow, but Box stock has become an institutional favorite , with positive operating cash flow, only $40 million in long term debt on $528 million of assets, and a clear growth path.

It reminds me of a company called Harbinger , which I worked for in 1984. They built a home shopping service on floppy-disk PCs. I co-wrote the manual. The press conference launch was embarrassing, although the food was good, and I lost track of it. But from that failure they found they had built a corporate invoicing system, considered quite nifty for the 1980s. The company was eventually sold off to Peregrine Systems for $2.1 billion .

The Bottom Line for BOX Stock

Box is a get-rich-slowly stock, becoming healthy on its own, but you can easily see it being sold-off, in time, to a larger company, setting up Levie for the next stage of his career. When his hair is all white, he'll still be a respected player in the Silicon Valley game.

But Levie is no Mark Zuckerberg, and Box is no Facebook. It is what it is, a corporate storage and software company. For investors, that should be good enough.

Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stock has been on a long 20% slide since its June highs. This week, management reported earnings and the reaction was violent. First there was a negative knee-jerk dip to $170 per share in after-hours activity, but it reverted sharply higher.

Alas the jubilation didn't last, as the stock tumbled 3% in open session trading.

BABA delivered a strong earnings report. They beat on sales but missed on earnings. Also the stock drifted lower on chatter of one-time charges and renewed talks of rising tensions with China, and on the day of another $16 billion in tariffs.

To me this changes nothing for Alibaba stock. These headlines are short-term in nature and do not negate the facts that this is a money-making machine. And therein lies the opportunity.

Management blew away the revenue expectations on the back of strong e-commerce activity. This includes their foray into the cloud, which currently contributes but a small portion so it has a lot of potential. The point is that they are doing the right things and those require some spending. Hence, a miss on profitability doesn't worry me at this stage.

Even though I am convinced that the BABA stock is viable, I can't trust the upside potential to materialize for as long as we have China tariff headlines looming. So instead of buying the shares outright and risking $174 per share with no room for error, I will use the BABA options. There, I sell puts into what others fear to generate income without any out-of-pocket expense.

Fundamentally, it has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 46, which sounds high. But it pales when you compare it to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) which is also a momentum growth stock. BABA is 70% cheaper. Even then, as long as they continue to grow this fast, I don't worry as much about margins.

The bottom line is that BABA is successfully executing on plans and they are expanding into the right areas. To do that they have to spend a bit more than normal, so yesterday's scare was misplaced.

Technically, BABA stock had a pivotal 2017 when management made a strong statement. Investors believed them and pushed the stock to a new level. This year the dips have challenged the necklines from which they broke out several times. Although this is good news and builds confidence in support, it also makes them crucial to hold. Losing footing around $165 per share could bring another 10% dip from there. This is one scenario not a forecast.

BABA Stock Trade Ideas

The Bet: Sell the BABA DEC $145 put and collect $2.50 per contract to open. I have a 85% theoretical certainty so that I retain maximum gains. Otherwise, I will accumulate losses below $142.50.

Selling naked puts carries big risk, especially for a momentum stock like BABA. For those who want to mitigate that, they can sell a spread instead.

The Alternate Bet: Sell the BABA DEC $145/$140 credit put spread which would deliver over 15% in yield but with much smaller risk. Both setups have about the same odds of success and neither requires a rally to win.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently became the first U.S. company ever to surpass a trillion dollars in market capitalization and has continued to build on these gains over the past few weeks in the midst of what has now become the longest bull market in history.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), with market caps of $929B and $840B, respectively are threatening the trillion dollar barrier as well. Close behind is the original tech giant - Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and it's been on a great run lately with earnings and future estimates rising and a current market cap of $828B.

The ""Lost"" Decade

After its meteoric rise from the tiny software startup founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to the world's largest software company, Microsoft shares spent over a decade stuck in the mud, with essentially no share appreciation from 2001 until 2013.

(In all fairness, Microsoft did start paying a quarterly dividend in 2003, so the total return to investors was not actually zero, but it was close.) Public perception was that the company's products had grown stale at the same time Apple was making major gains in the desktop computer market with its fresh and intuitive products powered by Mac IOS.

A Vanity Fair article in 2012 titled ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"" compared the company's technology to Sears (NYSE: SHLD ), the once-mighty retail and catalog powerhouse who's offerings fell swiftly out of favor with consumers.

Blame for Microsoft's malaise was heaped on the shoulders of CEO Steve Ballmer, who took over from Bill Gates in 2000 and steered to company into many new areas - video games, e-books, search, etc., none of which were ultimately very successful.

New Leadership

In 2014, Satya Nadella, the former head of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division, took over as CEO and almost immediately put the company on firm footing once again. With a series of strategic acquisitions and a restructuring that focused on its core strengths - rather than chasing ideas like social media and mobile phones that were already crowded with formidable competitors - Microsoft regained its position as a leader in operating systems, office suites, server technology, and enterprise software.

It also launched a project called Azure Information Protection that allows businesses to protect data as it moves between servers and devices that has become Microsoft's fastest growing product, growing 89% in revenues in Q2 2018 year-over-year.

Editor note: I got my first inkling that something powerful was happening at Microsoft in the summer of 2015 when I was killing some time at a mall in Palo Alto with my 13 year-old nephew while our relatives shopped for clothes. His choice (after a quick trip to the candy store) was to spend 2 hours at the Microsoft retail store playing video games on a 20-foot high array of screens - and when we arrived there, a bunch of his buddies were already there.

Microsoft shares have been one of the best large-cap performers over the past four years, with the shares rising 200% over that period. Earnings are on the rise and future estimates are as well, with 15 analyst revisions over the past 60 days, earning MSFT a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The resurgence of Microsoft teaches us two powerful lessons. First, even the best companies can lose their way if they chase fads that seem to be working at other firms at the expense of their core expertise. Second, they can definitely get their mojo back if they refocus on producing the best possible new versions of the products where they've already been the leader.

The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

""We have to focus on the forest of spend, not the trees of trade and then we can make the big money.""

That's what CNBC personality and hedge fund manager Jim Cramer recently said after noting that the U.S. economy isn't one powered by manufacturing and industry. Rather, the U.S. economy is powered by consumer spending. Thus, Cramer's point is that focusing on President Trump's trade crusade misses the big picture. Instead, investors should look at how strong the economy is. To do that, investors should look at how strong the consumer is.

Cramer is right. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of America's total GDP . So, as goes the consumer, so goes the U.S. economy - and the stock market.

More than that, consumer spending on goods is only 20% of GDP. Consumer spending on services accounts for a whopping 50% of GDP. That's right. Half of the U.S. economy is driven by the consumption of services.

Thus, I'd like to extend Cramer's thinking out a bit further. Following consumer spending is smart. But, following consumer spending on services is even smarter. If you want to pick real winners in this stock market, go look at some services stocks.

With that in mind, here are 15 services stocks which you should consider adding to your portfolio as the economy heats up.

Services Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)

Source: Shutterstock

When it comes to services stocks, one of the bigger, stronger names with a ton of firepower is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

Amazon is traditionally thought of as an e-commerce giant, but it is so much more than that. Amazon is an omnipotent services company extending its fingertips into every services sector possible, including cloud, logistics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, streaming entertainment, digital advertising and so on and so forth. Because of this wide reach, it really isn't that hard to imagine a future in five to ten years where Amazon has a business in every sub-segment of the services economy.

Bears continue to knock the valuation on AMZN stock. But, so long as this company keeps disrupting, Amazon will continue to dramatically expand its addressable market, and AMZN stock will head higher . In a nutshell, this is a long-term winner.

Services Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)

The biggest service stock of them all is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).

America's first trillion dollar company got to a trillion dollar valuation by selling must-have consumer technology products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac. But that hardware business is starting to dry up. The next leg of growth at Apple will be powered by the company's rapidly growing Services business, which is essentially a collection of subscription services that Apple offers to its ecosystem of users.

Growth here has been red-hot (30%-plus), and it is high-quality growth (gross margins are sky high and stable). Meanwhile, AAPL stock trades at just 18x forward earnings. That's an exceptionally reasonable multiple for a high-growth services stock. Consequently, AAPL stock has nice upside from here with mitigated downside risk.

Services Stocks to Buy: Square (SQ)

One of the fastest growing services stocks in the market is Square (NASDAQ: SQ ).

Square is a pure play on the cashless revolution. The company provides payment processing solutions which enable digital and card payments across multiple different sales points. Because the whole world is going cashless, demand for Square's suite of services has skyrocketed over the past several quarters, and revenue growth has accelerated from 40% a year ago to 60% last quarter. This accelerating revenue growth has powered SQ stock 200% higher over the past year.

Valuation is a slight concern for SQ stock at these levels. As such, I'd wait for a pullback to enter. But, long-term, the growth narrative surrounding SQ stock supports materially higher share prices several years down the road as cash becomes a relic of the past.

Services Stocks to Buy: Facebook (FB)

Source: Shutterstock

The best thing about Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is that it provides arguably one of the world's best services at no financial cost to its users.

Between Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, the Facebook ecosystem has 6 billion monthly active users. None of them pay a dime to use any of those platform's core services. Meanwhile, because of its massive reach, Facebook's ecosystem continues to attract a ton of ad dollars, which are flowing en masse from traditional channels to digital channels. As this shift continues to play out over the next several years, Facebook will be a big winner because nobody else, outside of Google, has comparable global reach.

Bears are concerned about falling engagement on the core Facebook platform. But where is that engagement going? Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which are owned by Facebook. Thus, at less than 25x forward earnings, FB looks like one of the best services stocks to own here and now.

Services Stocks to Buy: Adobe (ADBE)

Source: Shutterstock

Lesser known but arguably just as powerful as other names on this list, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) is an attractive service stock because the company is a dominant force in its industry.

Adobe provides a suite of services for creative professionals and enterprises. Those services range from photo editing to document digitizing to analytics driven design, branding, and marketing. Across all those solutions, Adobe's competitors are largely nameless, and Adobe dominates the market. That is why this company's financials have been characterized by robust revenue, margin, and profit growth over the past several years.

This trend will persist as Adobe expands into new markets and dominates those markets, too. Meanwhile, ADBE stock isn't all that expensive at 40x forward earnings, considering its massive growth potential. Overall, this is a big-moat, big-growth stock with a reasonable valuation, and that makes it a solid long-term holding.

Services Stocks to Buy: AMC (AMC)

Source: Shutterstock

In case you haven't heard, movie theaters are back.

Box office attendance has bounced back in stunning fashion in 2018, and one of the biggest beneficiaries of this bounce-back is AMC (NYSE: AMC ), America's largest movie theater operator. Growth going forward looks promising because this whole industry is going towards a subscription model. MoviePass tried it out, but didn't have the assets or pricing power to pull it off. Now, AMC is adopting the subscription model, and that should provide a material lift to movie theater attendance over the next several years.

Meanwhile, AMC stock is still well off its multi-year highs. I think movie theater attendance is about to enter a golden era thanks to sustainable movie subscription services, and as a result, I think AMC stock will test its all time highs over the next several years.

Services Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)

Source: Shutterstock

Cord cutting has plagued telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T ) over the past several years. But, that could all change relatively soon.

Of all the telecom giants, AT&T is perhaps the best positioned to do well as cord-cutting persists. That is because AT&T has DirecTV Now, which is one of the largest OTT subscription services in the U.S. As cord-cutting accelerates over the next several years, DirecTV Now's user base should grow tremendously. That will help AT&T offset cord-cutting pain, while the rest of the business benefits from a massive 5G boom in 2019.

From a valuation perspective, AT&T stock looks safe here. The dividend yield is right around five year highs of 6%. It is hard to imagine that yield going much higher. Thus, over the next several years, I think AT&T sock could win thanks to a depressed valuation converging on improved operational results.

Services Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX)

Source: Shutterstock

If AT&T wants to point a finger at anyone for their recent struggles, that finger should be pointed at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).

The streaming giant has pioneered a new way to consume media through the internet. Everyone hopped on board because it was reasonably priced, was way more convenient than cable, and has recently been injected with a treasure chest of really good original content. All signs point to Netflix's OTT streaming service only growing by a ton more over the next several years as this internet entertainment trend goes global.

Having said that, NFLX stock is very richly valued, and there are competitive risks starting to materialize on the horizon. Thus, I caution buyers at these levels that the risk-reward profile isn't all the great, and that waiting for a big dip might be the better option.

Services Stocks to Buy: Weight Watchers (WTW)

Healthy eating trends and celebrity endorsement have driven Weight Watchers (NYSE: WTW ) stock more than 1,000% higher over the past three years.

As it turns out, a lot of people want to lose weight and look good in this visual-oriented world defined by Instagram, Snapchat and other photo-sharing apps. As the healthy eating and working out culture has grown over the past several years, adoption of the Weight Watchers program has grown, too. Weight Watchers has also received a nice lift from celebrities like Oprah and hip-hop artist DJ Khaled buying into the weight loss program.

Recently, WTW stock has been stung by slower growth concerns. But, subscriber growth is still nearly 30% and revenue growth is right around 20%. Thus, WTW remains a big-growth story. So long as those growth numbers remain healthy, WTW stock should perform well.

Services Stocks to Buy: Axon (AAXN)

Source: Axon

Not all services are directed at the consumer. For services directed towards law enforcement agencies, there is Axon (NASDAQ: AAXN ).

The company used to make a living sell smart weapons and body cameras to law enforcement agencies everywhere. Over the past several quarters, Axon has expanded their business model to sell smart weapons, body cameras, and a suite of cloud-hosted services to law enforcement agencies to help them modernize and optimize their operations. Appetite for these new solutions has been robust, and huge revenue and profit growth at Axon have powered AAXN stock to huge gains this year (+140%).

The valuation on AAXN stock is rich, yes, but the addressable market is huge and Axon's penetration rate is low. Thus, the growth runway is big enough and long enough to support AAXN's presently big valuation.

Services Stocks to Buy: Google (GOOGL,GOOG)

Source: Shutterstock

When it comes to services, there is no service more used in the world than Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) search engine.

Google search processes billions of search queries a day from presumably billions of users worldwide. Because of its unparalleled global reach, Google's advertising business is massive, and promises to only get bigger as more and more ad dollars come online. Plus, Google is taking its huge search database, and developing next-gen services with it. Those services include Waymo (self-driving), Google Home (smart home), and Google Cloud (cloud services).

GOOG stock is reasonably valued considering its broad exposure to multiple secular growth markets like AI, cloud and digital advertising. At just 25x forward earnings, there is a reasonable argument for GOOG stock to run higher over the next several years due to both earnings growth and multiple expansion.

Services Stocks to Buy: The Trade Desk (TTD)

Source: Shutterstock

When it comes to big growth services stocks, the cream of the crop is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD ).

The company, which provides programmatic advertising solutions for advertisers of all shapes and sizes, has found itself at the center of multiple tailwinds recently. Namely, programmatic advertising is the future, and as advertisers pour massive amounts of money into multiple different advertising channels, they are increasingly using data and algorithms to optimize spend.

That is why TTD stock has been on fire this year. Revenue growth has consistently run in the 50%-plus range, and TTD stock has risen 200% in 2018 alone. A 200% gain in eight months is tough to replicate, but Trade Desk is attacking a huge market, of which it controls only a tiny piece. As such, TTD stock should continue to head higher in the long run.

Services Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP)

In the e-commerce world, a service stock that all investors should know about for the next several years is Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ).

Shopify provides cloud-hosted services which enable retailers of all shapes and sizes to operate an e-commerce business. Considering the whole world is moving towards digital shopping, these services are of increasing importance. Moreover, considering the economy is becoming more and more entrepreneurial everyday , Shopify is enabling an entire new class of independent retailers that didn't exist before.

From this perspective, Shopify is tapping into a potentially massive market of retailers ranging from multi-million dollar enterprises to start-up operations selling shirts out of a garage. Shopify is presently gabbing only a small portion of that massive market, and as such, this company's long-term narrative supports big growth for the next several years.

Services Stocks to Buy: Palo Alto Networks (PANW)

Source: Shutterstock

Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ) provides what will arguably turn into the most valuable service in the world over the next five to ten years.

That service is protecting the immense amount of valuable data that is moving online. As all that data migrates to the digital channel, it becomes susceptible to hacks. As such, cybersecurity solutions to prevent such hacks will become increasingly important as more and more data goes online. Considering the amount of data in the world is expected to grow by ten-fold by 2025, cybersecurity solutions will naturally become very important over the next decade.

Palo Alto Networks is the king of the cybersecurity space. They are a huge cybersecurity player that continues to grow at a robust rate, a testament to just how much better PANW is than its peers. With respect to the stock, PANW stock is pricey at 44X forward earnings. But, the long-term growth narrative surrounding the ever increasing importance of cybersecurity solutions is robust enough to support the valuation.

Services Stocks to Buy: Disney (DIS)

There are signs that the Disney (NYSE: DIS ) turnaround is here, and my bet is that this turnaround only gains momentum over the next several quarters.

Disney stock has been weighed down by cord-cutting concerns recently. But, the company is prepping a DTC streaming service to offset those headwinds. Thus, Disney is turning into Netflix, and in so doing, could become one of the most valuable services stocks in the world.

After all, when it comes streaming services, it's all about content. Disney has all the best content. Marvel to LucasArts to Pixar to Disney themselves, the company has the world's biggest treasure chest of blockbuster hits. Disney will take all that great content, throw it on one streaming service, and consumer demand will subsequently be huge. Thus, when Disney's streaming service launches in 2019, DIS stock could get a huge boost.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, AAPL, FB, ABDE, AMC, T, WTW, AAXN, GOOG, TTD, SHOP, PANW, and DIS.

The post 15 Services Stocks to Buy for a Piece of U.S. Economic Growth appeared first on InvestorPlace .",2018-08-24,Amazon
https://www.nasdaq.com/article/rd-spending-hits-the-fastest-pace-in-12-years-top-5-winners-cm1012705,"The U.S. economy suffered from a lack of big ideas for a while. But that's not the case now. There has been a surge in research and development (R&D) spending at corporate houses, particularly this year. It is a welcome change and indicates that companies are finally putting their money into innovative ideas to boost productivity, which has been lagging badly.

Research and development increases market participation, helps a company stay ahead of market trends and keep it relevant. Thus, investing in companies that have stepped up investments in R&D so far this year seems prudent.

Business Investments in Intellectual Property Rise

As per government and corporate data, several companies are pouring billions of dollars into R&D, thereby driving business investments in intellectual property at the fastest pace in 12 years. Per FactSet nearly 215 S&P 500 companies said that their R&D investments on a quarterly basis increased more than $19 billion to $140 billion in the first half of this year compared to the same period a year earlier. That's an annualized growth rate of around 33%.

Bureau of Economic Analysis also added that private-sector investments in intellectual property, which includes R&D, have grown at an annualized rate of 11.1% to $893 billion so far this year. This, in turn, contributed about 0.5% to the 3.1% annualized economic growth rate, their biggest contribution since 1999.

What Boosted Spending in R&D?

Most of the companies did have plenty of cash on hand, so availability of capital hasn't affected spending in R&D. Moreover, it's not the capital but the market opportunities that determine whether a company will in invest in R&D or not.

So, is it the recent corporate tax cuts that have got to do something with the spike in R&D? Sure, there is a possibility. Companies are currently capitalizing on the recent tax cut to increase their R&D expenditures, since the law requires amortization of R&D expenditures beginning in 2022.

Big Spenders in Intellectual Property

Big U.S. tech firms and pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in R&D. Of the S&P 500 companies that report R&D quarterly, the top spenders in their last two quarters are Amazon ($14.01 B), Alphabet ($10.15 B), Microsoft ($7.65 B), Apple ($7.08 B), Intel ($6.75 B), Merck ($5.35 B), Johnson & Johnson ($4.79 B), Facebook ($4.76 B), Bristol-Myers-Squibb ($3.65 B), Pfizer ($3.53), Celgene ($3.45 B), Cisco Systems ($3.22 B), Oracle ($3.04 B), Qualcomm ($2.81 B) and International Business Machines ($2.77 B), per FactSet.

Each of these companies is trying to maximize their market share for fast growing technologies including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and new generation drugs. Amazon, in particular, doesn't use the term 'research and development' but states 'technology and content' that includes outlays on equipment, property, software and artistic content.

Investments in R&D by automakers, aerospace, other industrial companies, energy, materials and chemicals are surely missing the list. However, we all know that a lot of investments are required for self-driving vehicles and renewable energy to name a few, which have the potential to transform our world in the next few decades. Fortunately, General Motors, Ford, Lockheed Martin, General Electric and Exxon Mobil do have a very large R&D budget, an encouraging sign indeed.

Why R&D Matters?

The research that we do at present will certainly lead to amazing goods and services of tomorrow. A high level of R&D invariably leads to higher productivity growth, which will eventually help the broader economy grow at 3% or more.

R&D, by the way, boosts the standard of living and labor productivity. This again bodes well for the economy. Remember, that the United States has invested more than $550 billion a year in R&D, nearly 25% of total global outlays. But China and several other Asian economies are catching up, with growth rates that are twice as high.

5 Top Players Worth Buying

Given the importance of R&D and the pace at which it has picked up, investing in stocks that are spending big on tomorrow's ideas is the best thing to do right now. Their innovative approach and the zeal to stay ahead of the pack will surely boost profit margins in the long run.

Wall Street's Longest Bull Run Shapes Winners and Losers

The U.S. stock market recently recorded its longest rally, largely fueled by the rise of solid consumer discretionary companies and the world's most powerful tech firms, along with an unmatched era of easy money from low interest rates.

The broader market has garnered $18 trillion in wealth since the S&P 500 bottomed on Mar 9, 2009, creating potential winners. However, not everyone has partaken in this decade-long rally. Let us thus take a look at the potential gainers and losers of the longest-ever bull run.

U.S. Stock Market on Longest Bull Run

The bull run of U.S. stocks became the longest in history at 3,453 days, completed on Aug 22. President Trump tweeted after the market closed that it's the ""longest bull run in the history of the stock market, congratulations America!""

The U.S. stock market's longest-running upswing survived a decade of financial and political turmoil, thanks to the accommodative monetary policy, strength of the global economy, Barack Obama's stimulus packages and Trump's recent tax overhaul policy.

Needless to say, the underlying strength in fundamentals on the back of government outlays, better-than-expected earnings and upbeat consumer confidence are expected to push stocks higher for at least another year, if not longer.

Investing mantras like ""sell in May and go away"", by the way, failed to deter the bull run, with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 7% since the beginning of May. The broader index that tracks 500 major public companies in America has traded almost nine and a half years, without tanking 20% or more. During this phase, the S&P 500 has soared 320%.

The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite, in the meantime, rallied 290% and 520%, respectively.

Factors that Led to a Decade of Rising Prices on Wall Street

In the last decade since the Great recession, the Fed has kept interest rates at ultra-low levels and in the process pumped billions of dollars into the economy through quantitative easing. Such low interest rates helped consumers borrow money and spend in the economy, eventually leading to growth and driving stock prices higher.

Steady global growth also helped the stock market scale northward. Despite the ongoing trade war issues with the United States, Beijing managed to record slower growth avoiding a complete collapse. Eurozone's sovereign debt crisis isn't a concern anymore and risks stemming from Italy, Turkey, Venezuela and Argentina are more or less manageable.

Obama's stimulus worth $1.4 trillion and Trump's tax cuts fueled corporate profits and supported U.S. stocks. Trump has trimmed corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% from the beginning of this year, arguing that it will help companies to create more jobs.

Top-Performing Sectors in the Historic Bull Market

The recession compelled consumers to cut down on spending, but, in the bull run there has been a significant change in their attitude. Consumers have become more confident and are spending on almost everything, from jeans to handbags to home furnishings, as an uptick in personal income and employment are adding to their incomes. Thus, consumer-focused companies have benefitted, with the consumer discretionary sector leading the performance (read more: Retail Spearheads the Longest-Ever Bull Run: 5 Top Picks ).

As recent as the second quarter of this year, disposable personal income increased $167.5 billion, or 4.5%, which followed a gain of $256.7 billion or 7% in the first quarter. At the same time, the current jobless rate dropped to 3.9%. This is the eighth time that the unemployment rate has fallen below the 4% mark since 1970. The unemployment rate is now at a nearly two-decade low (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy on a Historic Job Growth Streak ).

Tech firms are also among the most valuable companies in the stock market. They have played a pivotal role in driving the record-setting bull market. They accounted for nearly 26% of the stock market's value as of today, by far the largest, and up from 16% before the financial crisis.

Tech firms have become an integral part of people's day to day lives, and the data they collect on users' social interests and spending habits have become essential. While computer and software makers are having a ball backed by the White House's initiative to trim tax rates, high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things and automation are driving demands for chips.

So far in this rally, sectors like financials, Industrials and Real Estate also witnessed a sharp rally.

Stocks That Are Big Winners

The biggest online retailer, Amazon.com, Inc., and the first to surpass a trillion dollar market capitalization, Apple Inc., are among the best performing stocks of the current bull market. While Amazon has gained a whopping 3,000% in this period, the manufacturer of mobile communication and personal computers skyrocketed more than 1,700%.

Amazon's high-profile membership service has set a new milestone and is now well positioned to capture the next wave of online retail. Amazon's aggressive expansion, unique market positioning and capability to disrupt new industries also helped its stock scale new highs despite lofty valuations. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has trended 38.8% upward over the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

Meanwhile, Apple - a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company - has seen a monumental run, courtesy of products such as iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 8 plus, Apple watch, Apple TV, Macs and the upcoming HomePod ""smart"" speaker. Apples' profit and revenues have been climbing steadily, while it has amassed a mind-boggling hoard of cash in the last six years. The gains have more or less come from the iPhone. The consensus estimate for the Cupertino-based company's current-year earnings rose 2.5% in the last 60 days.

Chip makers such as NVIDIA Corporation are also considered to have contributed immensely to this bull run. NVIDIA's shares have jumped 2,886%, so far, in this bull run.

Not All Are Lucky

This bull market has not been kind to all. Shares of The Mosaic Company fell around 27% since Mar 9, 2009. In fact, it is one of the only four companies listed in the S&P 500 that has lost ground in this time span.

Another company that has ended in the red is Apache Corporation, whose shares dropped 18.2%.

The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

https://reuters.com//article/us-shazam-m-a-apple-eu/apple-to-gain-unconditional-eu-approval-for-shazam-buy-sources-idUSKCN1L71N3,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its planned acquisition of British music discovery app Shazam, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The deal, announced in December last year, would help the iPhone maker better compete with Spotify (SPOT.N), the industry leader in music streaming services. Shazam identifies songs when a smartphone is pointed at an audio source.

The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into the deal in April, emblematic of its recent worries that companies may buy a data-rich rival to mine it for information or drive others out of the market.

The EU antitrust authority said it was concerned that the Shazam deal might give Apple an unfair advantage in poaching users from its rivals.

It also cited worries about Apple possibly halting referrals from Shazam to rivals of Apple Music, the second-largest music streaming service in Europe.

The Commission’s competition spokesman, Ricardo Cardoso, declined to comment. The EU executive is scheduled to decide on the deal by Sept. 18. Apple declined to comment.

The Commission took over the case from national EU regulators following a request from seven European countries including France, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

Apple did not give a value for the deal. Technology news website TechCrunch said at the time the price could be as much as $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately held Shazam.",2018-08-22,Apple

https://reuters.com//article/us-aac-tech-results/apple-supplier-aac-tech-posts-first-profit-drop-in-four-years-on-weak-phone-market-idUSKCN1L715Y,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (2018.HK), an acoustic components supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said on Wednesday second-quarter net profit fell for the first time in nearly four years, hit by plateauing iPhone sales and a sluggish global smartphone market.

Shares of AAC plunged almost 11 percent after the company said net profit dropped 39 percent from a year earlier to 653 million yuan ($95 million), the first quarterly fall since July-September 2014. The stock later recovered, closing 1.3 percent higher.

“Apple in terms of volumes is hitting a plateau this year, and while it has been successful in driving product prices and profits, volume stagnation affects its suppliers,” said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research.

AAC, which supplies acoustic and haptic components for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, was estimated by research and brokerage firm Sanford Bernstein to derive half of its revenues from the U.S. tech giant.

While Apple reported better-than-expected results for the June quarter, shipment volumes for iPhone and iPad were almost flat from a year earlier.

AAC’s quarterly revenue fell 14.5 percent to 3.79 billion yuan, the biggest such drop since 2009, with margins also hit by a stronger yuan.

The company, which also supplies leading Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], said smartphone unit sales were weaker than expected in the quarter amid a shrinking global smartphone market.

AAC competes against China’s Goertek and US-based Knowles as one of the world’s largest acoustic component makers. Shah at Counterpoint said the increasing number of products with microphones, such as smart speakers and TVs represent a bigger business opportunity, but competition is also tough.

AAC managing director Richard Mok told a media briefing that the company expects better profit margins in the traditionally stronger second half of the year, citing growth potential for its new optic lens business.

The escalating China-U.S. trade war is not hitting the company directly at the moment, Mok said, with none of its products or components on the list of those imposed with higher tariffs.

The boy, 16, from the southern city of Melbourne, broke into the U.S. computer giant’s mainframe from his suburban home many times over a year, The Age newspaper reported, citing statements by the teenager’s lawyer in court.

The teen downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files and accessed customer accounts without exposing his identity, the paper said.

Apple contacted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation when it became aware of the intrusion, The Age said, quoting statements made in court. The FBI then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

The report said an AFP raid on the boy’s family home produced two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported by Apple.

The sensitive documents were saved in a folder called “hacky hack hack”, the report said.

It said the boy had boasted about his activities on the mobile messaging service WhatsApp.

An Apple spokesman said the company’s information security personnel “discovered the unauthorized access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement” without commenting further on the specifics of the case.

“We ... want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised,” the spokesman said.

The AFP declined to comment because the matter was before the court. A court spokeswoman also declined to comment other than to say the teenager would be sentenced on Sept. 20.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a finding by a California jury in favor of patent holder Core Wireless Licensing SARL. The appeals court did not disturb the jury’s finding that Apple infringed a different Core Wireless patent but asked the lower court to reconsider its enforceability, opening the door for Apple to nix the verdict entirely.

https://reuters.com//article/us-apple-japan-investigation/apple-accused-of-pressuring-game-rivals-in-japan-nikkei-idUSKBN1L1050,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese regulators are investigating Apple Inc over allegations it unfairly pressured Yahoo Japan Corp to slow the expansion of its online games platform, which competes with Apple’s App Store, Japanese media reported on Thursday.

People visit an Apple store in Istanbul, Turkey August 15, 2018. REUTERS/Murad Sezer

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is looking at whether Apple interfered in Yahoo Japan’s operations by pressuring it to cut back on developing its Game Plus web-based service which enables users to stream games without downloading apps, the Nikkei newspaper reported.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman at Yahoo Japan, one of the country’s most successful internet companies, declined to comment on the report, but said that the site continued to add game titles.

Shares in Yahoo Japan fell around 2.5 percent in early trade, while the broader market slipped 0.5 percent.

Last month, the FTC said Apple could have breached antitrust rules by forcing Japanese mobile service providers to sell its iPhones cheaply and charge higher monthly fees, denying consumers a fair choice.

Game Plus offers free and fee-based games developed by Square Enix Holdings Co and other game publishers, some of which are also available on the App Store for Japan-registered users. Yahoo Japan’s gaming site has more than 60 million monthly users, which the company and game publishers can tap for usage history and other data.

According to the Nikkei, Yahoo slashed its budget for the platform last year, and has largely stopped promoting the service. Meanwhile, game publisher Square Enix in April removed a game that had been developed exclusively for the site, the newspaper added.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/teslas-ahead-of-the-competition-can-stay-in-front-cm1014500,"Tesla got a big jump on the competition in the battle to create the perfect electric car with driverless capabilities. More escapades like the company's going-private saga, however, could provide the opening other companies need to close the gap.

After nearly three weeks of drama, Tesla (TSLA) founder and CEO Elon Musk announced in a blog post Friday that he had changed his mind about taking the electric-car maker private. Apart from any lingering SEC investigations, that chapter in Tesla's story appears closed, turning the focus back to the fundamentals of its business: manufacturing and selling battery-powered vehicles.

Alex Wong/Getty Images

And that can't happen soon enough. Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer argues that Tesla risks ceding the future autonomous driving market to competitors. In an increasingly competitive market, Tesla will need to devote resources and attention to developing its technology. Tesla still has a five- to 10-year head start over new entrants in terms of brand awareness and capabilities, but as its sideshows take center stage, better-funded rivals could make inroads. For Dorsheimer, that represents the greatest risk to Tesla's potential.

""A series of self-inflicted problems could open the door for new entrants with greater financial backing,"" Dorsheimer wrote, noting Toyota Motor's (TM) recent $500 million investment in Uber to develop driverless vehicles. General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and other automakers are also devoting considerable resources to new electric vehicles.

In the meantime, Tesla is growing more cash-constrained. Dorsheimer, who rates Tesla at Hold, assessed the company's sizable debt-repayment requirements in a report Tuesday morning: ""With $2.2B in cash at the end of Q2, Tesla only has enough cash to maintain operations for another six to nine months at its current rate....With a $230M tranche due in November 2018 at $560/share and $920M due in March 2019 at $360/share, Tesla will need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency.""

Going forward, investors will be watching whether Tesla hits its announced target of producing 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter, including 6,000 per week by the end of August. Tesla must hit that rate of production to survive, Dorsheimer says. Thanks to the distractions caused by the going-private saga, Dorsheimer trimmed his estimate for Model 3 production in the quarter to 48,000 units from 52,000. He decreased his price target on the stock as a result, from $336 to $316 - approximately where it trades today.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-wins-court-case-against-ontario-government-over-rebate-cancellation-20180828-00940,"Reuters





By Anna Mehler Paperny

TORONTO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - A Canadian court has ruled in favor of Tesla Inc after the electric carmaker challenged the province of Ontario's wind-down of an electric vehicle rebate.

In a ruling on Monday, Judge Frederick Myers of Ontario struck down the transition program set up by the new Ontario government, which excluded Tesla customers from qualifying for rebates.

""Tesla only sought fair treatment for our customers and we hope the Ministry now does the right thing by delivering on its promise to ensure all [electric vehicle]-owners receive their incentives,"" the spokeswoman said in an email on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for Ontario's Attorney-General said the government is reviewing the ruling ""and will make a decision on how to proceed in the coming days.""

Tesla's challenge arose after Ontario's Progressive Conservative government in July canceled a slew of green energy initiatives, including an Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Incentive Program that provided rebates of up to C$14,000($10,640) for people who bought electric cars.

Premier Doug Ford's government, which came to power the previous month, made provisions for people who had already bought or ordered cars but structured the transition program in such a way as to exclude Tesla, which does not use franchised dealerships.

In challenging the program, Tesla called this an ""arbitrary"" exclusion.

Myers agreed, calling the exclusion ""arbitrary"" and ""egregious"" in his ruling, in part ""because the (Transportation) Minister singled out Tesla for reprobation and harm"" without providing the company a chance to be heard.

https://www.smarteranalyst.com/analyst-insights/canaccord-cuts-price-target-tesla-tsla-upcoming-debt-obligations-cause-concern/,"With Friday’s blog posts from Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) board and CEO Elon Musk, the electric car giant is scrapping plans to go private. At least as of right now, Tesla’s conclusion is that going private would be too much of a hassle for the company, and a burden on its shareholders.

Canaccord analyst Jonathan Dorsheimer believes the drama associated with this endeavor, which includes tweeting “funding secured,” is a great example of why even a great company may need different leaders during its life cycle.

The analyst remains sidelined on TSLA shares, reiterating a Hold rating, while cutting the price target to $316 (from $336), which represents a slight upside potential from current levels. (To watch Dorsheimer’s track record, click here)

Dorsheimer commented, “Less than three weeks after announcing he was considering taking Tesla private, Elon Musk announced that he has decided against going through with the transaction. What was at best a premature announcement has generated three weeks of distraction from one of Tesla’s most important quarters to date. As the dust has settled, the result has been a nominal change in stock price, along with an SEC investigation and multiple class-action lawsuits. We feel less confident in the company’s ability to meet it’s 50,000 to 55,000 production guidance indicated at the end of Q2.”

“With higher performance models and cash buyer Model 3s being prioritized, Tesla will be able to stave off cash concerns in the short-term. However, its upcoming debt obligations are cause for concern. With a $230M tranche due in November 2018 at $560/share and $920M due in March 2019 at $360/share, Tesla will need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency,” the analyst added.

Wall Street believes Dorsheimer is smart to play it safe when it comes to the company’s prospects ahead, as TipRanks analytics reveal TSLA as a Hold. Out of 27 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 8 are bullish on Tesla stock, 10 remain sidelined, while 9 are bearish on the stock. With a slight upside potential, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $322.05. See TSLA’s price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks.",2018-08-28,Tesla

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202597-tesla-4000-top-bull-market?source=nasdaq,"We count Tesla among the story stocks in our current bull market that must be considered outrageous. Some find it plausible that Tesla could trade to $4,000 per share. You should be hearing an alarm bell at this time.

As traders, we often do well by fading the outrageous. Outrageous events and valuations often happen at or near market tops either for individual securities or the entire market as a whole. For those of us who were in the market during the dot-com boom and bust, a few of these story stocks may be memorable. The climb to the top of the market for these dot-com stocks was based upon the outrageous premise that there were abstract concepts that were more important than a company's financials and fundamentals to determine a stock's valuation. Only in the latter stages of a bull market will such outrageous perceptions become commonly accepted.

We now appear to have advanced into such a time frame where some stocks are being valued primarily upon factors other than actual fundamentals and financials. This has happened before throughout the history of markets and this uber-bullish sentiment can last for quite some time as markets surprise to the upside. We know that over-extended markets eventually regress to the performance of historical averages. There is simply far less probability for the outrageous to become reality in the long term. Our experience has taught us that when outrageous events and attitudes become commonplace in the market, then it may be time to adopt a contrarian point of view. Accordingly, we are likely to sell outrageous short in conjunction with the chart. We want to see the signs of buyer's exhaustion and failed momentum on the chart prior to shorting a market or individual stock.

Charts, and stop losses, are crucial because outrageous markets can certainly exceed the expectations of even the most astute market observer. Market history is filled with more than one intelligent expert who has been too early in their deeming the asset levels in the market ""irrationally exuberant."" Momentum is a powerful force that can take markets either higher or lower than one might reasonably expect. The chart may provide an indication as to when this momentum has stalled. By identifying inflection points in markets, a trader may be able to achieve maximal entry points for their long or short trades.

^IXIC data by YCharts

Trader's Idea Flow respects the excellent work of Seeking Alpha author Daniel Jones who has written an interesting article. Mr. Jones's article brings to light a recent viewpoint by a respected investment firm that is so outrageously bullish that it must be addressed. As a veteran of the dot-com boom and bust, we must state that the uber-bullish sentiment that has become commonplace in much of today's market is eerily reminiscent of another market top from days gone by. In the late 1990s, most of us knew the market was far ahead of itself and almost everyone believed that a sharp correction was coming. But knowing when that correction would actually occur was the challenge needless to say. Of course FOMO was not a popular acronym being used back then to identify a trader's Fear Of Missing Out on the easy gains being made. But FUD certainly was present as everyone's Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt increased with the market's inexorable move higher into a parabolic event as the new millennium dawned. But we all knew there would be a severe price to pay when the market returned to its senses. Outrageous is a temporary condition.

This is a cautionary article about how outrageous concepts can actually become plausible in the minds of some investors when we are near the top of a bull market. Perhaps one of the most outrageous combination of events now occurring on Wall Street can be found at Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Full disclosure: We are fans of Tesla the company although we are concerned whether Tesla can survive the damage that continues to be done to the fundamentals, the brand, and the immediate future for this company by its current CEO Elon Musk. Tesla is at a crucial crossroads right now that could determine the company's very survival. We want to see Tesla survive and we believe the company has a far greater chance of survival in a post-Musk future. As traders, we recognize opportunity and we sold Tesla shares short between $375 and $380 on 8/8/18 as discussed in this recent Seeking Alpha article. We recognized outrageous and we sold it short.

Outrageous conduct has been on display in full view of the market involving Tesla's CEO Musk for some time now. Concurrently, an outrageous price target of Tesla $4,000 per share has been introduced to the market's discussion of this stock via the open letter from ARK Invest. Yes, that is correct: Tesla $4,000 per share. We could discuss with great hyperbole the romantic notion of an auto industry stock driving endlessly higher at ludicrous speed with no brakes. We could imagine endless amounts of never-ending, free capital to fund this vision for the auto company. We could pretend that this company is somehow different and better than the competitors who are rapidly rising to challenge Tesla. We acknowledge that the Tesla $4,000 scenario relies upon the advent of Mobility as a Service. But we believe it is outrageous to be discussing Tesla's role in this future evolution of the market that may or may not include Tesla when the company has so many very serious immediate challenges.

More prudent discussion points of Tesla's future might include challenges as well as opportunities. For instance, China is the world's largest EV auto market. Tesla has just 3% of the market share in China and has discussed plans for the opening of a new Gigafactory in Shanghai. Tesla may have valid concerns for the protection of the company's valuable IP in China. Chinese engineers will likely be employed by Tesla in any future scenario for a Shanghai Gigafactory. It is possible that big Chinese competitors BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF) and Geely (OTCPK:GELYF) would be interested in Tesla's IP. We see too much consideration of the outrageous as being plausible by investors and not enough consideration of the many risks that exist for Tesla's share price at current levels.

This discussion of Tesla competing in China may be a moot point, since Musk has not disclosed any plan of action to finance the necessary billions of dollars in capital needed to build a new factory in Shanghai. There may not be any plan to make this factory a reality as this may be just another ruse and distraction by the erratic Tesla CEO. Since Musk constantly has Tesla ensnared in PR bombshells, SEC investigations, shareholder lawsuits, teary-eyed interviews with the New York Times, and bizarre tweets with the next dramatic distraction, there simply isn't time for dry and boring questions about production and/or the acquisition of capital. Perhaps Musk would take a number of these distractions with him if he were to be given a leave of absence for whatever length of time is necessary.

In order to maintain our outrageous / top of the bull market narrative of Tesla $4,000 per share, we need to dismiss the following pesky fundamental items: shareholder lawsuits, legal liabilities, SEC investigations and fines that could total into the billions of dollars; forget about $1.3 billion in convertible debt coming due in November and March; $3 billion accounts payable; never mind dwindling cash reserves combined with an uncertain ability to raise capital; and if a capital raise is possible, then at what cost for Tesla to once again increase its more than $10 billion debt burden?; and not to worry about the apparent ramping up of customer refund demands since this cash pool now comprises more than a third of Tesla's total cash on hand.

Outrageously, we can simply deem these normally crucial items as unimportant. Just forget these insignificant details for now. All of these boring and dry questions regarding other people's money, perhaps your personal investment account money, they are just not that much fun to discuss while we are in the middle of a truly outrageous discussion of Tesla's valuation.

We are of course big fans of world-changing innovation and technologies that can contribute so much to the advancement of society, the economy, and protection of the environment. Tesla's Musk has demonstrated a proclivity for splitting his time and energies among various and diverse commitments as if light refracted through a prism. With Tesla seemingly challenged on many fronts at this time with rapidly approaching financial deadlines that may be complicated by an ongoing SEC investigation, shareholders might benefit from the 100% focus of the CEO's resources on the survival of Tesla, Inc. Let's keep uppermost in mind that this serious event of an SEC investigation has been brought on in large part by Musk's inaccurate claims on items like $420 buyouts. The SEC has certainly noticed that funding was not secured for this Tesla buyout as Musk falsely claimed in his infamous tweet. An SEC investigation into Musk and / or Tesla could make it very difficult or even impossible to complete a deal for a new capital raise that is becoming more of a necessity at this time.

It has been Musk who has presided over the corporate governance and financing decisions that have led Tesla to this highly-leveraged balance sheet that is putting the company in such a precarious position currently. Shareholders are increasingly aware that the upcoming events in the near term could spell make or break for the company's survival. Perhaps the investors in Tesla's debt and equity would be better served if their CEO focused his personal resources on the management and implementation of solutions for the plural crises that Musk has created at Tesla after his years of questionable management.

The development, financing, manufacture, sale, and support of next generation cars is a very challenging endeavor alone. Shareholders, bondholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and Americans viewing Tesla's survival as important would appreciate far less wunderkind theatrics from the CEO. Only if Tesla survives in the near term will there be time later for the company to advance world-changing concepts like solar energy applications and Mobility as a Service (MaaS).

Instead of a procession of seemingly endless distractions created by CEO Musk, it might be appreciated if this corporate executive would focus like a laser beam on the implementation of solutions for current problems. The $1.3 billion in convertible debt that is coming due in a few months and the $3 billion that is now owed to suppliers would be a good place to start. At a later date, let's discuss technologies that could become economically viable in perhaps 5-10 years into the future. For now, let's deal with a self-inflicted SEC investigation, shareholder lawsuits, legal liabilities, and the potential billions in unnecessary expenses that this CEO has just cost shareholders of Tesla's equity.

Perhaps it would not be unreasonable for Tesla's board of directors to actually place some parameters around their erratic CEO. One guideline to consider could be: when you cost the company billions, threaten its very survival, invite an SEC investigation, damage the brand, destroy credibility, possibly terminate the ability to achieve a capital raise (and you managed to achieve all of this damage with just one tweet), then the board shuts down your Twitter account. Hopefully this guideline is not considered overly stringent or too difficult for the independent board of directors at Tesla to address.

Candidly, neither Wall Street nor any potential buyers for Tesla could have been that impressed with the company's current condition. If Tesla were on its way to $4,000 per share in the not too distant future, wouldn't some consortium of investors have been willing to step up and steal a bargain for Tesla's buyout at $420 per share? No, there were no takers at $420. And before the actual discussion of a realistic valuation advanced very far, Musk pulled the buyout card off of the table under the cover of an 11 PM Friday night press release.

Let's be clear that it has been the Tesla/Musk camp including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Silver Lake who have advanced the notion that Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) and Silver Lake themselves were interested in Tesla. Yet no mention of any terms were given that would likely have accompanied any such interest, if in fact this interest was actually documented. No form of documentation of this interest or any terms have been presented. Yet a dozen media outlets rushed to announce that unidentified ""sources"" reported that Volkswagen and Silver Lake were interested in Tesla. Really? Or was this the work of crisis management firm Joele Frank spinning this situation with unconfirmed news? Interestingly, there has been zero counter-party confirmation from Volkswagen at all on this report of their interest in Tesla, as of this writing.

Let's also be crystal clear on the important point that Tesla and Musk have not been the poster children for accuracy of corporate statements recently. And as far as Musk's statement about ""his decision to remain public,"" let's consider that the marketplace may have given Musk a mandate that his idea for a buyout at $420 was a non sequitur. The current demand may not be very strong for dangerously leveraged buyouts of companies with no earnings, erratic CEOs, SEC investigations, unknown additional billions in liabilities forthcoming, and quality control / production issues in the face of rising competition. Shocker.

Trader's Idea Flow believes that the Tesla spin that was given to the market on Friday night was a result of the newly-hired crisis management firm of Joele Frank drawing upon their retainer fee paid to them by Musk and company. We could be wrong. Maybe Tesla $4,000 is coming instead of a buyout at $420.

Musk's first attempt to save face and run for backup to the Saudis resulted in the Saudis announcing they were in discussions with Tesla rival Lucid Motors. Well, that was embarrassing and rather inconvenient for any genius, entrepreneurial CEO who has recently displayed his mastery of the Twitterverse. So as the Tesla camp attempts to spin this Musk-inflicted debacle via crisis communications management they float the undocumented, unverified idea of interest by Volkswagen and Silver Lake. Since Silver Lake is involved with Tesla in this P.T. Barnum circus tent event anyway it was not a stretch to have Silver Lake say, ""Sure. We are big-time players who were interested... but since there are not enough other big-time players like us around, we are finished here."" Zero commitment, no capital spent, no documents signed, and it raises Silver Lake's profile as a big player on Wall Street. Volkswagen's alleged participation in the deal may have been a calculated gamble since Volkswagen would be unlikely to voice opposition to the Tesla public relations statement. After the fairly recent emissions scandal at Volkswagen, their legal team may have wisely advised silence on this issue. In fact, the mention of Volkswagen as a player in a potential deal for Tesla also heightens the German automaker's profile on Wall Street in a positive light. Not a single thin dime was offered up and no commitments were made by Volkswagen in this report. What level of credibility would you like to assign to this ""report"" from ""sources"" coming out of the Tesla camp that Volkswagen and Silver Lake were serious players at $30 billion? If the stock is heading to $4,000 per share, then we might have seen other parties lining up to secure the rest of the funding.

Our experience has shown us that the more outrageous events and valuations become in the market, the closer we may be to a bull market top. Current events at Tesla and the consideration of a $4,000 stock price as plausible seems to be fairly outrageous to us.

Summary

Perhaps the Tesla Board of Directors needs to have the wisdom and courage, or the SEC needs to have the jurisprudence to bring balance into their relationship with Musk. Accountability and structure can be very positive in the team-building effort that Tesla might benefit from. There are tens of thousands of jobs and billions of investor dollars at risk here in this situation. Candidly, we take the inappropriate conduct of Tesla's CEO Musk very seriously. In fact, it is of concern that this potentially great American company is currently at risk. We want to see Tesla succeed and believe a post-Musk future is in everyone's best interests.

Tesla's CEO has become a major distraction and liability for the company's survival. Events like a public company's CEO getting into a monthly war of tweets with various people ranging from former employees to heroic rescue divers simply cannot be allowed to continue. In the bizarre case of the trapped Thai soccer team Musk played no useful role in the rescue. The Tesla CEO did manage to damage the high profile reputation of Tesla and its products by insulting one of the actual heroes of this rescue mission. Musk name-called one of the rescue divers in yet another of his errant tweets.

This type of inappropriate conduct by Tesla's Musk is not helpful for the performance of the company's stock or the reputation of the brand. For the many investors who have made strong profits in Tesla's stock, you may be willing to overlook the increasing number of warning signs coming from this highly questionable conduct being exhibited by Musk. The ride higher on Tesla's stock performance has likely been outrageously great fun. You may now be lulled into a false sense of complacency or perhaps you feel apathetic regarding Musk's conduct. Perhaps you are even now believing that it is plausible to easily advance towards financial independence on the ride to Tesla $4,000. After all, it is a bull market you know... until it is not.

Prudent investors can be far less fun to hang around. In fact, they can be a serious buzz-kill. But prudence enables investors to keep their trading accounts alive and preserve bull market gains. Outrageous has the strong potential to end badly for complacent investors who have allowed their eyes to become glazed over as the gains have just seemed to come so easily in this bull market. This trap combines greed, over confidence, and complacency that can soon become fear and denial in a sharp market downturn.

For those of us who survived the dot-com boom and bust, some of us are feeling an eerily reminiscent sense of the bizarre that has crept back into this bull market after so many decades of being absent. The acceptance of outrageous in our marketplace has returned once again. It is almost like the re-emergence of a deceptively evil character from a Steven King novel that returns every few decades to wreak carnage and steal souls by seducing the naive and innocent down into the dark abyss below, never to be heard from again. Okay, so perhaps a little overly dramatic there. But if you have ever seen the value of your brokerage account plunge relentlessly lower, then you definitely understand the misery and horror of that story. So let's be prudent and protect ourselves from the evil of severe stock market losses. Tesla's CEO and current valuation discussions are outrageous. Outrageous is not good. That is the point of this article.

The graphic below illustrates just how far above the average returns on the S&P that we are now experiencing. Can these above average gains continue? Yes, they definitely can continue for a few more years possibly. But they could also end tomorrow. Be aware when you see outrageous and protect your gains as you see fit. Do not allow yourself to become overconfident or complacent.

Conclusion

Trader's Idea Flow recently entered our first short sale of Tesla stock on the morning of 8/8/18 as we published this post to our marketplace community. We posted later that night to our blog. Perhaps Musk's most bizarre tweet to date regarding the now infamous, ""Funding secured."" message was the catalyst for our short sale. We indicated our skepticism for the chances of a Tesla buyout at $420 per share. And just sixteen days after our short sale, Musk issued this stunning reversal under the cover of an 11:00 PM Friday night press release. Due to such erratic behavior, reasonable investors may not be willing to entrust Tesla's CEO Musk with billions more in capital as the clock rapidly ticks down towards Tesla's insolvency. Furthermore, there may be the question of an ongoing SEC investigation that focuses upon Musk and the infamous ""funding secured"" tweet. It may be in the best interests of shareholders for Musk to be removed immediately so that Tesla can recapitalize for the sake of the company's survival.

Here's a quote from the WSJ that summarizes the current state of Tesla's emerging crisis:

""Tesla is under increasing pressure to generate cash after burning through $1.8 billion in the first six months of this year. The company has about $1.3 billion in convertible debt due in November and March. It had $3 billion in accounts payable and just $2.2 billion in cash on hand as of June 30. Including capitalized leases, long-term debt tops $11 billion, according to FactSet.""

Musk now struggles to meet production goals that may or may not enable the company to survive in the short term. But this CEO's previous choices may have all but dashed the company's hopes to remain competitive in the future as the highly-leveraged balance sheet may not allow for the insatiable need for capital to be met. Billions more in capital are needed to pay suppliers on accounts that may now be in arrears, meet the upcoming payments of convertible debt, and build the aforementioned Shanghai factory. R&D must be maintained or ramped higher in an increasingly competitive marketplace. And it is estimated that the cost of building out the global EV fast-charging infrastructure could be $360 billion. Currently, Tesla's place in the race to stay current in the global buildout of this crucial infrastructure technology is tenuous, at best. Upgrading existing charging stations and building new stations will require billions more in capital expenditures from Tesla.

Discussion of the other future Tesla models that have been promoted by Musk is not even appropriate at this time. There simply is no capital to even consider such expensive future projects. At this time Tesla is rapidly approaching a crossroads that are all about survival now, not projects in the future. This is the disastrous condition that Musk's leadership has brought upon Tesla at this time. Discussing the immediacy of paying the billions of dollars that are now coming due / overdue at Tesla, for which Tesla simply does not have the capital to pay, seems to be a secondary concern for many market participants.

Instead, bull market stock valuations based upon ""visionary"" events that may never happen have people discussing Tesla at $4,000 per share. Mobility as a Service is another of the many imagined wonderful topics for Tesla's future to be contemplated during outrageous, top of the bull market discussions. For now however, we would like to see just how Tesla plans to meet the billions in financial obligations that are currently owed or soon coming due. Never mind Tesla $4,000. How about communicating on the marketing plan to deal with the possibility of sharply lower demand for products as the EV tax credit is phased out in 2019?

A story stock like Tesla may be one of the more hyperbolic stock valuation scenarios in this current bull market. This is not a good thing. Reasonable investors would likely agree that the current bull market is one of the longest running bulls in history. When the next bear market returns, and it will, story stocks with little substance to their stratospheric valuations are among the most vulnerable for severe losses.

Clearly, there is a certain amount of bull market premium built into this market currently. But the bull market premium typical of many stocks may be exponentially exaggerated in the current price of Tesla shares. While almost none of the increasing and substantial risk to shareholders seems to be currently priced into Tesla shares, at least 100 points of outrageous bullishness seems to be built into the current valuation of Tesla shares. We believe that there is a very substantial disconnect between the current condition of Tesla the company and the current valuation of Tesla the stock. As we are so often reminded in the market, these types of inefficiencies can suddenly correct seemingly without warning. Risk happens fast as illustrated in the graphic below. A number of sources have recently reported Tesla's hiring of Joele Frank to handle communications surrounding the proposed buyout of Tesla. We now know that this bizarre buyout calamity caused by Musk had no basis in reality. Tesla has released a carefully-scripted press release stating that the company will remain public. So this tells us that Tesla has not hired Joele Frank to handle communications for Musk's imaginary buyout. Tesla has hired the communications firm for some other reason. A cursory study of Joele Frank's website tells us that a public company's engagement of this crisis communications management specialist may portend upcoming ominous events.

Tesla $4,000 is an outrageous consideration. The fact that some market participants consider this valuation for Tesla to be plausible in the not too distant future may be symptomatic of a market top. Stocks about to increase by 1000% in value generally do not hire firms specializing in crisis management communications.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202347-livermore-partners-report-q2-2018?source=nasdaq,"On the short side, we began to see some profits in Q2 and began to fish for real value in the resource pond as gold entered a new bear market.

2018 performance continues to be strong for Livermore Partners. Even in the face of a turbulent global backdrop, we continue to benefit from a strong US market and Brent crude pricing. Which given lack of re-investment is finally in position to hold a strong price band ($70-80/bbl) with spike potential to $150/bbl, especially given geopolitics and sanctions globally taking center stage.

The interesting dynamic today is that even with all the political discord, US equities outperformed and remained strong in the face of a powerful US dollar and weak emerging markets. This bifurcation allowed unique opportunities to flourish if one was positioned well. Thankfully, we were.

Therefore, I am pleased to share that as of June 30, Livermore Strategic Opportunities LP ended with a gain of 15.44% through Q2 2018.

Much strength came from core holdings in both long and short positions. Notably, our core long positions in APAC Brent oil-producer Jadestone Energy (OTC:JADSF), British-luxury brand, Burberry (OTCPK:BURBY), and the newly restructured Bank of California.

Additionally, in the quarter, we began to fish for real value in the resource pond as gold entered a new bear market. Especially, today as the US dollar seems ""peaky"" and a possible inflation threat finally coming to light, we now have secured growing stakes in beaten down Mexican producer, Torex Gold (OTCPK:TORXF), exciting London-listed resource play, Solgold (OTCPK:SLGGF), as well as Toronto's Detour Gold (OTCPK:DRGDF), where billionaire and legendary investor John Paulson is now an activist.

see link

We are supportive of Paulson and feel Detour is a mismanaged organization with an extremely weak Board. We will be helpful to the process where possible. Given our new and low basis on the shares, we see a chance to profit in the short to medium term.

With Jadestone (JSE), our thesis continues to manifest along with very strong returns for this exciting and growing oil producer. Jadestone successfully IPO'd in London in August under the symbol, JSE LN.

see link

JSE executed a $200mm transformational Australian asset acquisition from Thailand giant, PTTEP. We hold a seat on the Board of Directors of JSE, added to the equity position on the raise, and continue to focus hard on its growth trajectory.

Jadestone has a chance to be a true small cap champion and the potential to be a $1B company in the face of Brent oil's uplift near $75 a barrel. Adding to this are the strong free cash flows from the new Montara acquisition, which on a proforma basis, will allow $100mm of annual FCF for a company today trading at a large discount (1.5X EV/EBITDA for 2019) to any peers. We continue to feel Jadestone is in a great position to prosper in the years ahead thru both acquisition and organic growth and reflects the strength of an excellent management team. My hats off to CEO Paul Blakeley and his team!

Our Burberry had another strong quarter. Livermore's initial investment was justified at 1400 pence just after Brexit in summer of 2016. Given we begun as an activist in pressing for structural and operational changes. Today, we believe the company is well-positioned for operating margin expansion and a greater focus on profitability and sales per square foot, reflecting what Livermore sees as a business that can again become a champion and generate strong returns for shareholders. We embrace new CEO Marco Gobbetti and see the turnaround having a strong chance at success. The shares are now up 20% YTD and we remain steadfast holders.

On the short side, we began to see some profits in Q2. We are an opportunistic short player and use it as a tool to hedge our long book at times, though we are event driven, so exposure can fluctuate.

Given China weakness, we have profited from select bets, such as the ""much loved"" Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), where we see continued high cash spend on new ventures as well as a slowing consumer and weak yuan untimely causing issues. Along with the black box of BABA as an ADR, which is very opaque on its finances… Yet, investors feel its multiple should be on peer with other US tech titans. We don't.

Another notable and much talked about short is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which Livermore is on the side with the bears. All I see today are many ""cult like"" investors hoping that Tesla is the next Apple, which I do not see occurring. It is this cult that holds the stock up (as well as the large short position of nearly 20%). This is important, seeing that it is this equity that must be used as a currency to fund the massive outspend. Once that dies off, so does the vision and finances of Tesla. It is the ultimate downfall and cause of many such ""bubble stocks"" contingent on its equity and capital markets to fund large future capital outspend.

We are short TSLA given their large cash burn (see Bloomberg graph), negative free cash flows (nearly $4B in past four Quarters), and ever-growing debt burden. We see structural difficulties in its future. From true competition such as Jaguar and Porsche: from lack of operational execution to its poor corporate governance, I don't understand the need to own the stock (or bonds) at today's valuation. The shares are massively overpriced given the risk/reward of what lies ahead.

Overall, our special situation theme has been successful. So, we must continue to focus on uncovering hidden value. The fundamentals of the US economy remain vibrant, although one must begin to gauge the length of the current (and ever extending) economic cycle. All the while asking the question: Just how long can this market push higher without a true correction or potential recession?

Livermore will remain focused on specific undervalued opportunities, especially where activism is possible. To explore new paths and structures current management teams and boards are struggling with. Given the low valuation in the emerging markets and UK, we are now looking hard at select situations where we can add value and hopefully unlock upside. It is never easy, but today more than ever, it becomes a required tool. One in which Livermore looks to implement and reflect value for all stakeholders, in a mindful and methodical manner.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-tesla-goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-cm1014059,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL - August 28, 2018 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features: Tesla TSLA , Goldman Sachs GS and Morgan Stanley MS .

Tesla to Remain Publicly Traded: What Now?

In a surprising turn of events, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted an official statement to the company's blog late Friday night stating that he - with the input of the board of directors and a team of outside advisors that included Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners - had decided to abandon his plans to take the company private.

Musk had previously used Twitter to make public his consideration of taking the company private at a price of $420/share and said that he had ""funding secured,"" setting off a firestorm of speculation about the who's, what's, when's, and why's of a potential deal.

In the aftermath of the original tweet, Musk explained that the funding he was referring to was a potential investment from the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund and that he thought as many as two thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would opt to maintain their ownership stake in the new private entity, reducing the total cash needed to complete the transaction from the original estimate of roughly $72 billion to something closer to $25 billion.

S.E.C Investigation

Reportedly, The S.E.C. has expanded an investigation into Musk's prior public statements to include the possibility that his explosive ""go private"" tweet may have included material misstatements or omissions, which could constitute a violation of Federal securities laws.

Tesla shares rallied sharply after the original tweet, hitting an intra-day high of $379.57/share before settling back into a trading range around $320/share over the ensuing three weeks as details for - and doubts about - Musk's plans played out in the media.

It remains to be seen whether Musk's public statements represent any violation of the law, but clearly a lot of money changed hands in the aftermath and it's not inconceivable that Musk as an individual or Tesla as a corporation could find themselves defending civil liability from parties who suffered losses trading Tesla shares in the wake of his market-moving public statements.

Deal Scrapped

Ultimately, it seems that the deal was shelved because several large institutional owners of Tesla shares are subject to significant restrictions on maintaining an ownership stake in a non-private company. As of the most recent set of 13-F filings, 56 million shares of Tesla - nearly a third of the total 171m shares outstanding - were held by just six institutional investors, Baillie Gifford, T Rowe Price, Fidelity, Vanguard, Blackrock and Capital World Advisors.

The certainty provided by the regular reporting requirements for public companies is important for large mutual funds and small investors alike. Though the concept of avoiding the often negative press associated with publicly detailing Tesla's results as they attempt to become the world's largest automaker, the practical application of the plan proved too complicated.

Additionally, there were murmurs that a significant investment in the electric carmaker by an investment fund backed by big oil money could be a significant public relations issue and an apparent contradiction of Tesla's stated goals to free the world from dependence on fossil fuels for transportation.

What's Next for Tesla?

Aside from the pending investigation into the legality of the language and methods Musk used to communicate with the markets, not all that much has changed fundamentally about the company during its wild month of August. While it remains a traditional public company, investor focus will once again be on the amount of Model 3 autos the company has been able to produce and deliver to customers when they report next on November 7 th . Gross margins will be in focus as well as industry analysts debate the amount of profit Tesla is able to squeeze out of each new sale - which will have a significant impact on the company's financial situation.

If Tesla has been able to sustain production of 6,000 or more vehicles per week - on their way to the self-applied goal of 10,000 per week - and sell them at gross profits of 20% or more, the company will be well on its way to being sustainably cash flow-positive and will be able to bootstrap their way to production of the upcoming Model Y, the Roadster and the Tesla Semi truck.

If Tesla reveals any difficulty in producing and profitably selling their first mass-market vehicle, investors are likely to punish the shares as their tolerance for promises seems to be growing thin.

Though it's been a head-spinning month of developments for one of the world's most interesting and hotly-debated companies, in the end, investors fall back on the most fundamental factor of all - asking when can they expect profits rather than just talk.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-stocks-id-never-touch-cm1013833,"If you are a long-term investor, you need to be careful about what you add to your portfolio. Not only do you have to make sure you're buying something that is reasonably priced, but you must also understand the business and trust the people running it. Finding that sounds a lot simpler than it really is. Here are three big names that fail these simple tests for me: Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) , Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) .

1. Way too expensive for this flix

My family enjoys using Netflix and has since the days of renting DVDs through the mail. It was and remains a disruptive force in the media and entertainment world. From that perspective, it is a very exciting company and appears, for the most part, to be well run.

Fellow Fool Anders Bylund recently laid out the case for a positive outlook, noting that the company continues to grow its subscriber base (up over 25% year over year in the second quarter) and expand its already-impressive portfolio of company-generated content. Financially speaking, operating income was up a huge 262% year over year in the second quarter.

Image source: Getty Images.

I see three problems. First, as Anders admits, Netflix is burning cash as it spends heavily to create content. That won't end for at least a couple of years. Long-term debt is making up the difference, up nearly 30% in the first six months of this year alone. Second, the content it's creating is also building something of an arms race in the media industry, which means competition remains fierce. And then there's the price of the stock. With a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 150, investors are clearly pricing in a lot of success. This third reason borders on the absurd for anyone who believes in value investing.

Maybe someday I would be interested in Netflix, but not while it's burning through cash in a competitive media market and trading at extreme valuation levels.

2. Great cars, but too hot a stock

Tesla is another stock I wouldn't be interested in for some very similar reasons. There's no question that the company has been influential in pushing the auto industry in a new direction. Or that CEO Elon Musk is a visionary who is capable of seeing things in a way that I will probably never understand. And, to be honest, the electric cars Tesla makes are pretty darn cool.

But Tesla operates in a very competitive business. Automakers aren't sitting still allowing this upstart to own an important new industry segment. Moreover, Tesla is still in the growth phase, spending heavily to build its business. Cash burn has been huge, with debt funding much of the recent spending because the company keeps running low on cash, which is, in the end, the lifeblood of every business. To put a number on that, long-term debt was $2 billion at the start of 2016 and $9.5 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to turn a full-year profit, though it promises it will be in the black in the second half of the year. But Musk keeps adding aggressive new projects to the to-do list, like building electric trucks (which will supposedly come after the company manages to smooth out the troubles with the Model 3), turning ""sustainably profitable"" into a far more difficult task.

Image source: Getty Images

In the meantime, Tesla's valuation is extreme relative to peers. Since earnings are negative, let's look at price to sales . Its P/S ratio is just under four times, while its giant auto peers trade at less than 0.4. I wouldn't mind owning one of Tesla's cars, but at these prices, I certainly don't want to own the stock. And none of this even takes into consideration the unusual situation surrounding Musk's tweets about taking Tesla private . No thanks, I'm not up for this volatile ride .

3. It's a trust thing

Kinder Morgan is the kind of boring business I would usually find very attractive. It owns midstream energy infrastructure that would be hard, if not impossible, to replace. Much of its business is fee-based, providing a reliable stream of cash to support its generous 4.4% dividend yield. It also has big plans for dividend increases, with the goal of upping the annual per-share payment from $0.50 in 2017 to a projected $1.25 in 2020.

Although the path to that higher dividend isn't as clear as it used to be because of troubles with a growth project in Canada , Kinder Morgan is a huge company with many levers to pull to replace that big development . The real problem I have with it stems back to 2016, when the company slashed its dividend by 75%. Even after all the increases, the dollar value of the dividend in 2020 will still be lower than it was prior to the cut.

The drastic dividend decrease came at a time of industry weakness that limited Kinder Morgan's options for raising cash to sustain its growth spending. It chose to trim the dividend, which was probably the right choice even though it was a painful one for income investors. That decision, however, was partly driven by the company's heavy use of leverage compared to peers -- it put itself in a position where it simply didn't have a lot of options. It continues to make relatively aggressive use of leverage.

KMI Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts .

The biggest concern I have, though, is that just a couple of months before the 75% dividend cut, Kinder Morgan's management team was telling investors to expect as much as a 10% dividend hike in 2016. With leverage still relatively high and a history of going back on its word, I won't be investing in this midstream giant anytime soon regardless of its plans for growing its dividend.

The whole picture

When you look at a company you want to invest in, you should look beyond just the stock price. Netflix is not only expensive today, but it's increasingly using debt to support a media arms race in a very competitive industry. Automaker Tesla is also relying heavily on debt as it builds its still money-losing business in a competitive industry, and it's priced at a huge premium compared to more established peers. My issue with Kinder Morgan is a little different. The company's heavy use of leverage is a concern, but the big issue is trust, since management was telling investors to expect a dividend increase in 2016 just months before clipping its dividend by 75% instead. In the end, these are three stocks I won't be touching.

Tesla's go-private plans are off

Shares of Tesla slipped 1.1% to $319.27 following founder and CEO Elon Musk's late-night announcement on Friday that plans to take the company private are being dropped . Musk said in a blog post that according to feedback he has received, most shareholders would prefer the company to stay public. Tesla's independent directors also released a statement saying that the special committee set up to pursue the transaction has been dissolved.

Seventeen days after unexpectedly tweeting that funding was secured and that ""[i]nvestor support is confirmed"" for a deal to take Tesla private at $420 a share, Musk admitted that there were significant roadblocks to his plan. Some institutional shareholders have limitations on how much they can invest in private companies, and there is ""no proven path"" for most retail investors to continue to own Tesla shares if it were private. The mercurial CEO also said that the process of going private would be time-consuming and a distraction at a critical point in the company's history.

In other words, the reasons for canceling the deal are not very different from the questions observers have been raising since the original announcement, which had the stock price careening between $387 and $288. The muted reaction to the doomed idea today was probably more of a sigh of relief than anything.

Pfizer releases drug trial details

Drug giant Pfizer released details of a successful trial of a drug for heart damage from a rare disease, and although that company's stock had little reaction, falling 1.9%, shares of companies with potentially competing drugs reacted sharply. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALNY) soared 16.2%, Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IONS) jumped 7.8%, and Eidos Therapeutics (NASDAQ: EIDX) plunged 31.1%.

The trial was for tafamidis, a drug for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a rare and fatal disease where destabilized amyloid proteins accumulate in the heart and cause damage. Tafamidis stabilizes the proteins, slowing the progression of the disease, and the test results showed that it reduces hospitalization by 32% and mortality by 30%.

TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), the disease that leads to the heart damage, comes in two forms: a hereditary form caused by a gene mutation, and an age-rated version called ""wild type"" ATTR. The Pfizer drug is meant to stabilize the disease in both forms, while the drugs from Ionis and Alnylam are based on a new approach designed to silence the production of the abnormal proteins at the source, and are aimed at addressing nerve damage caused by the hereditary form only. In today's presentation, Pfizer revealed that the test results that showed benefits for subjects with the hereditary form did not have statistical significance, suggesting that the immediate threat to Ionis and Alnylam may be smaller than investors had feared .

On the other hand, Eidos, a small biotech that had its initial public offering in June, is working on a drug that targets both types of ATTR with a stabilization approach, putting it in head-to-head competition with Pfizer. It's not all over for Eidos by any means, but Pfizer is further along, and that had investors worried about its stock today.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-to-remain-a-public-company-cm1013857,"In a surprising turn of events, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted an official statement to the company's blog late Friday night stating that he - with the input of the board of directors and a team of outside advisors that included Goldman Sachs (GS) , Morgan Stanley (MS) and the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners - had decided to abandon his plans to take the company private.

Musk had previously used Twitter to make public his consideration of taking the company private at a price of $420/share and said that he had ""funding secured,"" setting off a firestorm of speculation about the who's, what's, when's, and why's of a potential deal.

In the aftermath of the original tweet, Musk explained that the funding he was referring to was a potential investment from the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund and that he thought as many as two thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would opt to maintain their ownership stake in the new private entity, reducing the total cash needed to complete the transaction from the original estimate of roughly $72 billion to something closer to $25 billion.

S.E.C Investigation

Reportedly, The S.E.C. has expanded an investigation into Musk's prior public statements to include the possibility that his explosive ""go private"" tweet may have included material misstatements or omissions, which could constitute a violation of Federal securities laws.

Tesla shares rallied sharply after the original tweet, hitting an intra-day high of $379.57/share before settling back into a trading range around $320/share over the ensuing three weeks as details for - and doubts about - Musk's plans played out in the media.

It remains to be seen whether Musk's public statements represent any violation of the law, but clearly a lot of money changed hands in the aftermath and it's not inconceivable that Musk as an individual or Tesla as a corporation could find themselves defending civil liability from parties who suffered losses trading Tesla shares in the wake of his market-moving public statements.

Deal Scrapped

Ultimately, it seems that the deal was shelved because several large institutional owners of Tesla shares are subject to significant restrictions on maintaining an ownership stake in a non-private company. As of the most recent set of 13-F filings, 56 million shares of Tesla - nearly a third of the total 171m shares outstanding - were held by just six institutional investors, Baillie Gifford, T Rowe Price, Fidelity, Vanguard, Blackrock and Capital World Advisors.

The certainty provided by the regular reporting requirements for public companies is important for large mutual funds and small investors alike. Though the concept of avoiding the often negative press associated with publicly detailing Tesla's results as they attempt to become the world's largest automaker, the practical application of the plan proved too complicated.

Additionally, there were murmurs that a significant investment in the electric carmaker by an investment fund backed by big oil money could be a significant public relations issue and an apparent contradiction of Tesla's stated goals to free the world from dependence on fossil fuels for transportation.

What's Next for Tesla?

Aside from the pending investigation into the legality of the language and methods Musk used to communicate with the markets, not all that much has changed fundamentally about the company during its wild month of August. While it remains a traditional public company, investor focus will once again be on the amount of Model 3 autos the company has been able to produce and deliver to customers when they report next on November 7 th . Gross margins will be in focus as well as industry analysts debate the amount of profit Tesla is able to squeeze out of each new sale - which will have a significant impact on the company's financial situation.

If Tesla has been able to sustain production of 6,000 or more vehicles per week - on their way to the self-applied goal of 10,000 per week - and sell them at gross profits of 20% or more, the company will be well on its way to being sustainably cash flow-positive and will be able to bootstrap their way to production of the upcoming Model Y, the Roadster and the Tesla Semi truck.

If Tesla reveals any difficulty in producing and profitably selling their first mass-market vehicle, investors are likely to punish the shares as their tolerance for promises seems to be growing thin.

Though it's been a head-spinning month of developments for one of the world's most interesting and hotly-debated companies, in the end, investors fall back on the most fundamental factor of all - asking when can they expect profits rather than just talk.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-is-staying-public-what-now-cm1013729,"In a blog post Friday evening, electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) put to rest any debate about whether the company may go private. CEO Elon Musk said feedback from experts and discussions with investors led him to ""believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public."" The decision came just a couple of weeks after Musk dropped the surprising and controversial news on Twitter that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share, asserting the funding for such a deal was ""secured.""

As investors assess the implications of Tesla remaining public, here are some things to consider.

Image source: Tesla.

Why Tesla is staying public

To help Musk fully consider the idea of a private Tesla, he not only consulted with merger and acquisition experts at Silver Lake, Goldman Sachs , and Morgan Stanley , but he ""also spent considerable time listening to current shareholders, large and small, to understand what they think would be in the best long-term interests of Tesla,"" according to Musk's Aug. 24 blog post.

These discussions ultimately led Musk to conclude:

Most shareholders preferred Tesla to stay public. Musk's hope for current investors to have the option to remain investors in a private Tesla proved to be unrealistic. Going private would be ""more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated.""

Also significant: When Musk met with Tesla's board of directors to explain he had changed his mind, they said they agreed with his conclusion.

Tesla's board continues to support Elon Musk

Importantly, even after what has proven to be an unnecessary distraction as the automaker attempts to ramp up Model 3 production and deliveries and achieve profitability, Tesla's board of directors appears to be totally supportive of Musk.

In a statement released on Friday, Tesla's board said, ""[W]e fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward.""

Tesla has a heightened risk profile

With Tesla choosing to remain public, this provides fuel for scrutiny of Musk's assertion on Twitter earlier this month that the funding to go private had been ""secured."" The tweet has been viewed by some as fraudulent and manipulative. A subsequent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and numerous lawsuits are also concerning.

Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster expects this fateful tweet will eventually prompt a class-action lawsuit against Musk. But as Munster notes, the company will likely ""be insulated from any claims given the company has made it clear that 'go private' is an Elon Musk initiative."" But Musk's historical importance to Tesla means anything that negatively impacts the CEO could eventually have a material impact on the automaker.

Ultimately, the biggest change for investors after all of this activity surrounding Musk's consideration of Tesla's privatization is a slight increase in the stock's risk profile.

Going forward, investors will want to keep an eye on the outcomes of the SEC's investigation and lawsuits. But the biggest concern remains whether or not Tesla can ramp up Model 3 production and achieve profitability.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-elon-musk-win-dismissal-of-lawsuit-over-model-3-production-20180827-00854,"Reuters





By Jonathan Stempel and Alexandria Sage

Aug 27 (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a securities fraud lawsuit in which Tesla Inc shareholders accused the electric car company and Chief Executive Elon Musk of misleading them about the progress of production of its Model 3 vehicle.

In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said that while shareholders claimed that Tesla fell short of its production goals, ""federal securities laws do not punish companies for failing to achieve their targets.""

The case is separate from lawsuits accusing Tesla and Musk of scheming to hurt short-sellers through Musk's Aug. 7 tweets about taking the Palo Alto, California-based company private, and that funding had been ""secured.""

Musk abandoned that proposal late Friday night.

Tesla formally launched the Model 3 in July 2017, touting it as a vehicle for the masses, and attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.

But shareholders said Musk knew Tesla was ""woefully unprepared"" to meet its production goal of 5,000 Model 3s per week, and that Tesla's share price was inflated until after the company finally cut its production target last November.

Belief in the Model 3 had helped propel Tesla's share price 62 percent higher in the 1-1/2 years after the Palo Alto, California-based company unveiled it in March 2016.

But the judge said shareholders failed to show that Tesla needed to be clearer that Model 3 production could fall short.

The company eventually blamed its production shortfall on ""bottlenecks"" at its battery factory outside Reno, Nevada and its assembly plant in Fremont, California.

""Plaintiffs are correct that defendants' qualifications would not have been meaningful if defendants had known that it was impossible for Tesla to meet its stated production goals, not merely highly unlikely,"" Breyer wrote. ""The facts plaintiffs have put forth do not tend to establish that this was the case.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breyer's decision is dated Aug. 24.

The case is Wochos v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-05828.

Never a dull day for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock. A few weeks ago, Tesla's celebrity CEO Elon Musk flirted with taking Tesla stock private at $420 per share, and Musk communicated that idea unexpectedly through Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). The tweet came after he slammed Wall Street analysts on a conference call and engaged in Twitter warfare with multiple critics.

Now, only days after hiring investment bankers for the potential go-private process, the deal is off. Citing the fact that most shareholders did not want the company to go private, Musk called off all go-private plans.

Through all this, Tesla stock has been taken on a roller coaster. It bounced from $300 to $350 after better-than-expected second-quarter numbers and a reaffirmed strong back-half guide. Then, TSLA stock roared to $390 after Musk's tweet.

The stock dropped to $300 rather quickly thereafter as the market questioned the legitimacy of Musk's ""funding secured"" claim. TSLA stock rebounded from that sell-off to $325 when Tesla started hiring investment bankers. Now, TSLA stock is dropping back to $310 with the go-private deal off the table.

In other words, TSLA stock has been perhaps the market's most wild stock over the past month.

Amid all this noise, the fundamentals have been somewhat overlooked by go-private chatter. Those fundamentals have dramatically improved. Namely, Model 3 production rates are ramping, demand and public awareness are as strong as ever and profitability looks like a real possibility in Q3.

Thus, while there will be a hangover effect on TSLA stock from all this go-private drama, the improving fundamentals will win out in the long-term. I think that by the end of the year, TSLA stock will head towards $400.

Model 3 Production Rates Are Improving

Tesla's biggest hiccup over the past several quarters has been sluggish Model 3 production. That appears to be changing.

According to Bloomberg , Model 3 production rates have steadily improved since June, and Tesla is now consistently producing 5,000 or more Model 3 vehicles per week (except for the last week of August, where production fell to 4,500, likely weighed by surrounding go-private drama).

If Tesla can maintain this strong rate of production, then that is a huge step forward for TSLA stock. No one is else mass producing an electric vehicle of this caliber or style. Thus, Tesla achieving mass production of the Model 3 will not only allow the company to finally meet robust demand but also puts the company far ahead of the competition when it comes to mass EV production.

Consequently, so long as these Model 3 production rates continue to improve, I think Tesla stock can head higher.

Demand & Public Awareness Are High

Another important factor in Tesla's fundamentals is demand. And, when it comes to demand and public awareness, Tesla is proving the old adage right: there is no such thing as bad publicity.

Although Musk and Tesla have been in the spotlight for controversial reasons over the past month, they have both been in the spotlight. Google search interest trends have been heading higher recently for Tesla , Elon Musk and Tesla Model 3 . Clearly, brand awareness for the company, its CEO, and its mainstream product are about as high as ever.

Is that a good thing? Perhaps.

Having sky-high public awareness correlate with sufficient, ramping production capability isn't a bad thing.

Moreover, multiple reports point to Model 3 production ramp corresponding with huge market share gains for Tesla in the auto-market (see here , here and here ). Despite the troubled headline risks, Model 3 production ramp has been met with equally large demand, and Tesla is gaining significant share.

I think demand will keep heading higher. Young investors are gobbling up TSLA stock amid all this noise.

I suspect that is because most young investors attribute a high brand value to Tesla. Keeping in mind that today's young investors are tomorrow's big consumers, this high brand value perception should be a leading indicator for big long-term demand.

As such, I think Tesla demand and public awareness remain high, and that production ramp will allow Tesla to keep gaining market share.

Profitability Around the Corner?

With production ramping and demand presumably still very large, Tesla could realistically net a profit in Q3 or Q4. If that does happen, then bears could be in trouble.

Tesla has netted a profit only twice before in its public history. The first time was in May 2013 . The second time was in October 2016 . Both times, TSLA stock rocketed higher afterwards and reached a new permanently higher plateau. The May 2013 report basically sparked a run from under $50 to over $200. The October 2016 report sparked a run in TSLA stock from $200 to $300.

In other words, history says that when Tesla reports a profit, TSLA stock goes on a big multi-month run. Thus, if Tesla reports a third or fourth quarter profit (which is possible given Model production 3 ramp and still strong demand), TSLA stock could rally from $300 to $400 and up rather quickly.

Bottom Line on TSLA Stock

Forget all the go-private drama, and focus on the fundamentals.

Right now, the fundamentals on Tesla stock are improving, and there is a realistic opportunity for Tesla to turn a profit in the back-half of the year. That profit could spark a huge rally in TSLA stock, and as such, I think TSLA stock could finish the year around $400 or higher.

""C'Mon … you can't really be surprised Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) isn't going private."" That's the essence of the message TSLA CEO Elon Musk delivered to owners of TSLA stock late Friday, ending two weeks of innuendo that the publicly traded company would likely be going private.

Instead, Musk says he now believes ""the better path is for Tesla to remain public,"" adding to his official statement ""the Board indicated that they agree.""

Thus ends another frenzied chapter of the Tesla saga, with the company exactly where it was when the matter was first stirred up by Musk's Aug. 7 tweet , ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""

In retrospect, however, no TSLA stock owner can truly claim to be shocked or disappointed. Even without Musk's penchant for hinting at events and outcomes that can't be delivered, his handling of the go-private deal - if there ever was a firm one on the table - was suspect from the beginning.

More Questions Than Answers for TSLA Stock Owners

Chief among the red flags? The vast majority of the time a publicly traded organization wants to go private, they don't say a word about it.

That's not to say word doesn't get out. Leaks happen. By and large though, the private equity firm or fund sets as a condition of the deal that nothing be said by the target company or its executives about it, as it can (and often does) drive the total cost of the acquisition higher. Tweeting that it could happen probably would have violated the buyer's terms.

Just as suspicious was the lack of confirmation from the other players on the stage.

Take, for instance, Musk's tweet from Aug. 13 that he was ""excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs"" as the privatization process moves forward.

It makes sense, on the surface. Goldman is an investment bank and advises organizations doing such deals. It's curious, however, in the sense that Goldman is anything but a believer in the electric car company. Goldman Sachs - at the time anyway - rated TSLA stock a ""Sell,"" sporting a price target of $210. More often than not, a publicly traded entity would choose an outfit it was on better terms with.

Whatever the case, Goldman did suspend analytical coverage of Tesla stock two days later, explaining that it would be ""acting as a financial advisor in connection with a matter that is fundamental to the reasonable analysis of the rating and price target for the stock.""

That didn't happen until two days after Musk tweeted it though, and Goldman never explicitly said it would be acting in the capacity of a privatization advisor (although there's little else it could be).

It's possible the deal wasn't even broached with Goldman until after Musk tweeted about it, forcing Musk to make good on his claim after-the-fact.

Last week, Morgan Stanley also dropped analytical coverage of TSLA stock around the same time Musk tweeted it too was serving Tesla as an advisor. Like Goldman though, Morgan Stanley wasn't exactly bullish on Tesla when the deal was inked. Its price target was only $300 at the time, down from a previous target of $379 … well below the $420 Musk said he was hoping the buyer would pay. The selection of Morgan Stanley, however, also tacitly underscored worries that the funding Musk suggested was ""secured"" was never all that secured.

All investment banks can connect people with capital with organizations that need it. Morgan Stanley, however, excels at it . If Musk needed to tap the firm two weeks after telling shareholders that funding had been secured, it may have never been quite as secured as initially hinted.

To that end, though Musk didn't initially suggest that the group interested in acquiring Tesla was the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, it was a reasonably good assumption. The fund's representatives and Musk had met several times in the recent past, and the fund owns roughly 5% of Tesla's outstanding stock . Clearly there's some interest there.

The Wall Street Journalreported on Aug. 13 , however, that the Saudi fund was ""struggling to find ways to finance its existing commitments.""

The Last Word

A complete fabrication? A half-truth? Just a misguided voicing of misinterpreted conversations? Did Musk say something that was material-but-not-factual, and then have to make it factual? Or, was it all just an effort to flush the short-sellers out of there trades, and keep them away for good?

It's likely nobody will ever really know how much substance there was to the matter, especially now that it doesn't matter. Given Musk's history for making off-the-cuff claims and setting unreasonable expectations though, it wouldn't be out of line to assume that little he said during the past two and a half weeks was as ironclad as he was making it out to be at the time.

In the meantime, Musk just wasted a little more of his already small supply of credibility currency.

Stocks opened higher on Monday as trade representatives from the U.S. and Mexico neared a deal to resolve certain disagreements on NAFTA. Reforming the trade agreement has been an outspoken focus for President Donald Trump since the election, and now, his administration appears ready to reach an agreement which will focus on the automotive industry.

Also this morning, investors continued to react to the news that Tesla TSLA will, in fact, remain a public company. Polarizing CEO Elon Musk confirmed this plan late Friday, saying that although he had secured funding for a go-private deal, an overwhelming amount of investors had encouraged him to keep the electric car giant public.

Wall Street also witnessed a slight selloff in Chipotle CMG shares as the fast casual Mexican chain was hit with a bearish analyst note this morning. This note, published by Wedbush, argued that near-term concerns related to same-store sales growth and margins could create headwinds for Chipotle as it looks to meet sky-high expectations.

https://www.smarteranalyst.com/bloggers-corner/staying-cautious-tesla-tsla-stock/,"Like a thief in the night, Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) controversial CEO disclosed that he was not proceeding with his brilliant plan in a blog post that was posted at 11ET last night–Friday night.

Quite the weasel move. I say when you screw up, man up. But not our Elon. He took the coward’s way out with a Friday night–late night–news dump. Hell, he didn’t even Tweet it.

Of course, the statement is filled with argle-bargle rationalizing the decision, and the previous big announcement about funding secured, $420/share, and all that.

He is sticking with the story that there was plenty of funding available. Really? Plenty of funding to take out shareholders at $420/share, and allow most of the existing shareholders to remain owners of the private firm in a magical structure never seen before, and almost surely a violation of the securities laws, and allow access to continued funds to fuel Tesla’s cash burn?

Musk of course had an alternative explanation for his U-turn: going private on the terms he had envisioned (or hallucinated) would be “even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated.”

Yes, attempting the impossible usually is pretty time-consuming.

What next? Well, Tesla’s structural financial problems remain. The company is facing the daunting challenge of navigating between the Scylla of Musk’s promise of no new capital raise and the Charybdis of the incessant cash burn. Not to mention the problem of a delusional megalomaniac CEO.

Charley Grant of the WSJ has been skeptical of Musk–well, by journalist standards anyways–but he misdiagnoses his and the company’s current predicament. Grant says that Musk made two mistakes in 2016–buying Solar City, and plunging ahead with the Model 3. But Musk really had no choice on either: letting SCTY fail or ditching the everyman’s EV would have undermined Musk’s aura in 2016–and that aura is what has kept the capital flowing since. If he had not done these things, Musk would have faced two years ago the problems he does now.

The other night I watched a BBC documentary about the Wars of the Roses, in which narrator (and historian) Dan Jones argued that Richard III wasn’t evil–the choices he made (killing Lord Rivers, kidnapping and then likely killing the princes in the Tower) weren’t really choices. If he hadn’t done those things he would have faced immediate doom. By doing them he bought some time–and delayed his doom. Richard did what was necessary to survive to fight again another day.

Methinks Musk’s situation is similar.

I was amused that Morgan Stanley had announced Thursday that it was advising Musk on the going private plan, and then Musk pulls the plug about 40 hours later. Does it really take that long to say “are you out of your fucking mind?” Or did it take them that long to recover from the giggles? Or maybe Elon just sat on the bad news from MS until he could release it with the least attention possible.

The only real questions remaining are: (a) what caused Elon’s synapses to conceive of this brilliant plan?, and (b) will there be legal consequences?

Insofar as (a) is concerned: LSD? Lack of sleep? Impending mental breakdown? Or was there something more desperately Machiavellian about it? Regardless, I can’t think of an explanation that bodes well for Tesla.

With regards to (b). It is so blindingly obvious now (and should have been from word one) that his announcement Tweets were materially false. They had large impacts on the price of Tesla stock. They followed years of other dubious announcements, both on Twitter and in SEC filings and investor disclosures. If the SEC lets this slide it will make a mockery of the securities laws, and suggest that there are different standards for some people.

Some have suggested that the SEC is reluctant to take actions that will kill Tesla, or crater its stock price. Well, why should Tesla be any different than other companies? SEC actions have cratered other firms. (Dynegy is an example that comes to mind.) The stock price falls were features, not bugs. The SEC actions cratered these other firms because they revealed widespread wrongdoing and material falsity in corporate disclosures that had caused stock prices to be greatly inflated. Why would the SEC want to perpetuate inflation in Tesla’s stock price? If the stock price can’t handle the truth, well, that would be the problem that the SEC is supposed to be addressing, wouldn’t it?

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 6, 2018

This video was recorded on Aug. 23, 2018.

Michael Douglass: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Thursday, August 23rd. We're doing a quick update on autos, more specifically Ford, but we'll talk a little bit about some of the other guys. Really, you can't help doing that when you talk about Ford. I'm your host, Michael Douglass. I'm joined by John Rosevear.

Now, listeners I should mention that this is pre-recorded. As you're listening to this, I'm in the Outer Banks, likely nursing a sunburn. It's distinctly possible things will have changed a little bit and there'll be a couple of things that have shifted by the time this gets to you. We're going to do our best -- we're recording this on Thursday, the 16th -- to say ""last week"" when we mean your last week as compared to ours. But give us a little bit of grace as we work through that.

John, welcome back to the show!

John Rosevear: Thank you! We should add that this is why we're not talking about Tesla, because the story will be different in 15 minutes, much less this week. [laughs]

Douglass: [laughs] I think that's incredibly true. Yes. I'm a former Ford shareholder, actually. It's been a story that I've tracked over the years with a lot of, sometimes optimism, sometimes pessimism, but a lot of interest. Let's trace the last month or so for Ford. The first thing that happened is, they had a really tough Q2 earnings report on July 25th. I mean a big negative surprise on profit.

Rosevear: Yeah. I should add, I've been a Ford shareholder since 2009. I'm in this for the long haul. Yeah, second quarter profit was a big eye-opener. It caught Wall Street by surprise. Net income was down 44% to $1.1 billion. Revenue was down 2.5%, which is almost a more significant problem.

What's going on here is, the good news is, Ford is still selling a lot of pickups in North America. That pays most of the bills. The tough news is that, they had a success story going on in China for a while, and it has completely fallen apart. Ford used to take a couple of hundred million every quarter in equity income from its joint ventures with Chinese automakers. They barely broke even last quarter. That was a real shocker.

In the meantime, sales have been good in Europe, but profitability has not. They posted a loss in Europe, despite good sales. There's a story there about what's happening. Europeans, like everybody else, want more SUVs. Globally, Ford has an issue where it's at the point in its product renewal cycle where the big selling categories are kind of stale.

That's brutal in China, because in China, you have all of the automakers you've ever heard of competing, along with a whole slew of domestic Chinese automakers that most Americans have never heard of. The market moves very fast. There's always something new, always something fresh. Ford's Focus was a huge seller in China when it came out five years ago. And now, it's dwindled down to very little.

Douglass: I should note, I'm a proud Focus owner. I have the '09 model. It's a good car! Personal viewpoint, obviously.

Rosevear: We have one, too. It's a fun car. But it's not the flavor of the month. That matters somewhat in the United States, it matters an awful lot in China. They've missed where the market went. They didn't have, maybe, the local intelligence on-the-ground people who spoke Chinese and deeply understood the market the way they should have. They've missed some things. I mean, we talk in America about everybody going for crossover SUVs. Well, everybody in China's going for crossover SUVs, too. Ford has the Kuga, which is the Chinese version of the Escape -- well, it's the overseas name for the Escape. They also have the EcoSport, the little one that they recently introduced here.

Sales have been down significantly. The EcoSport has done OK, but sales have not been what they should be. They've had to discount because of the feeling that these products are very dated compared to fresher stuff from other competitors. It's the same problem in the U.S., to some extent, although sales have still been good of the Escape and the Explorer and so on. And in Europe, they also sell the Kuga, the Escape, in Europe. But for them, for years, the big sellers have been the Fiesta and the Focus. They had an all-new Fiesta in Europe last year. It did very well. Sales are up. But it's not delivering the margins they hoped for. They're rolling out a new Focus over the next few months. They're also concerned about the margins there. They're going to get these out there that have fatter profits in all of these markets.

Douglass: Right. And Ford is talking about a ""transformation,"" which is going to cost $7 billion. When you think about $1.1 billion net income in a quarter, that's a pretty hefty price tag.

Rosevear: Yeah, it is. It is. I talked to Bob Shanks, it will be last week by the time our listeners hear this. He points out that that's spread over several years and it's going to come out of cash flow. It's not like they're drawing down their cash reserve to do this. It's going to come out of cash flow. He thinks that, in practice, it's not going to hit like that. They believe in giving you the price tag upfront and dropping the bad news in a very straightforward way. That's why they came out with that.

Douglass: Yeah, there's a car dealership joke there somewhere. I can't quite put my finger on it, but we'll get there. You got the chance to talk to Bob Shank, we'll talk more about that in a minute. One of the interesting things is that an analyst from Berenberg basically argued that a dividend cut would have to come. Ford's dividend is up to, what, 6% now? And you actually wrote about being maybe a little bit concerned about Ford's dividend, as well, I think somewhat understandably, given that all these things are incoming.

Rosevear: Yeah. This analyst's argument was, ""You're losing all that cash from China. You're going to have to keep spending money on all these other things,"" including the future projects, electric cars, self-driving vehicles, all that stuff that all the automakers are investing in right now. And it's like, ""They're going to have to cut the dividend."" It's 6%. They could cut it by a third and it's 4% at current prices. He has a sell rating on this stock. He was not optimistic.

I saw that, and I was hearing rumblings from other places and hearing from some readers who were like, ""Is this for real?"" So, I did an article looking at it. And I said, ""Well, Ford said in 2016 that the dividend is at a level that they can sustain,"" as they put it, ""through the cycle, through a recession."" As far as I know, that guidance is still operative. But, they have a new CEO since then, and many things have changed. It is true that back when they said that, in 2016, they expected 2018 to be a good year. Things started to go bad earlier than they had expected. So, I raised that question in an article. And that led to a conversation with Ford CFO. [laughs] As these things sometimes do. Bob Shanks, who is terrific. He's very smart, very capable. I said, ""Bob, is that guidance operative?"" And he said, ""It's extremely operative!"" [laughs] He only anticipates cutting the dividend in a severe economic situation, as he puts it, the '08-'09 scenario. They carefully set the regular dividend at a level that they're confident they can sustain. And when Bob says confident, he means confident. That's guidance.

What Ford has done in the last three years is paid a special dividend, sort of a bonus dividend, in the first quarter, to return some of the prior year's strong profits to shareholders.

Douglass: I think that's really interesting. Folks who listen to the Energy show certainly have heard discussions of companies with variable dividends in the past. What this essentially means is, you've got this sort of consistent, guaranteed dividend, and then possibly some variable pieces on top of that, depending on what Ford thinks it can do. That's a smart way to do things. It means you don't have to actually cut that regular dividend if things decline to some extent, and you don't have to be in the spot where you're like, ""Well, we've made a promise to shareholders that,"" well, not a promise, but sort of an implication, that when you set a dividend, hopefully you can maintain it for a long time. Instead, they're saying, ""Yeah, we think we can maintain this underlying dividend, but we'll do a little bit of extra when we can.""

Rosevear: Right, exactly, and it's to maintain everybody's expectations. With Ford, everybody includes the Ford family, which controls Ford via a special class of shares. But that class of shares gets the same dividend as the common stock. For some members of the Ford family, that's significant cash flow. They can forecast, ""What am I going to have next year,"" and so forth, in terms of income, around that. And that's important. Since there's a Ford who is chairman of Ford's board, Bill Ford, Henry Ford's great-grandson, their interests are represented at the table.

But the interesting thing here is Shank's rebuttal to the, ""China's not delivering the money, so cash flow is going to go in the tank,"" which was what this analyst had said. He said they're all missing something big. Ford Credit, their captive financing arm, their in-house bank, returns a couple of billion dollars a year, or close to it in pre-tax profit, and has for several years now. They've been reinvesting most of that in Ford Credit to grow its asset base, to grow its receivables. They're now at the point where they want to cap it. Ford Credit is big enough. What that means is that that cash is going to start to come back into the company. Ford targets, Bob told me, an 11% return on Ford Credit's equity. The equity is currently around $15 billion. That's about $1.7 billion of pre-tax profit every year at that target. We should note that they have guided to a considerably higher number this year. Bob points out that at that $1.7 billion, that covers around 70% of the regular dividend. It's not everything, but it's an awful lot of it.

Douglass: Of course, the flip side of that is that as those auto loans eventually roll off Ford Credit, they'll need to reinvest some of the cash to put those back in. I should mention, by the way, full disclosure, my very first loan as an adult was with Ford Credit. That's how I financed my Focus. I have thankfully paid it off, given that I was 21 and penniless. I maybe didn't have the cheapest rate in the world, although it was still very payable.

Rosevear: I haven't gone into that in great detail with Bob, what happens as sales go down. Obviously, new loan generation goes down. But three-year loans, whatever, you've got some time before those roll down. Even then, they're still selling a fair number of cars. They may take a larger share of the cars their dealers sell, because they only finance some transactions. Some dealers use other financing companies and so forth. They may find ways to take a larger share of the smaller pie to try and keep Ford Credit in fully invested, with its receivables where they want it to be.

Douglass: The upshot here is basically, if you're thinking of this as a Ford shareholder for a minute, you've got Ford Credit, which can probably cover around 70% of the regular dividend, assuming that 11% return on equity and those numbers that you just walked us through, John.

Then, also, Ford's got a big cash hoard, $25.2 billion as of the end of Q2. I think, if people are concerned about the dividend, the upside here is, it's probably going to be OK. Basically, if the dividend comes under threat, that's going to be because the business is really hurting, in a way that it isn't even currently right now.

Rosevear: Bob makes a point of saying that that cash hoard is specifically to fund things into a downturn and through a downturn. ""Things"" include the regular dividend. They intend to fund that out of cash. And then, he says, ""Of course, if we hit an '08-'09 situation and things get dire, then lots of things go out the window, possibly including the dividend.""

Realistically, they have that cash hoard, and then they have additional credit lines behind that of around $11 billion. It was $10.9 billion as of the end of the second quarter. I suspect that in a protracted recession, as the cash gets low and they're starting to think about trying on those credit lines, that's when the dividend goes out the window. It would have to be a real grinder.

Douglass: Alright, John, let's talk about Ford as an investment on the whole. The fact that we're even talking about, ""Hey, the dividend's probably safe,"" that's in part a conversation about the fact that the business itself has been, as you alluded to earlier, not been doing great. You're a shareholder. Obviously, you're holding your shares. What's your thought process there?

Rosevear: My thought process is that, part of what's going on is, Ford is shifting gears in a number of different directions.

Douglass: I see what you did there.

Rosevear: Yeah. Well. [laughs] If you follow Ford long enough, you start to be fond of things like Mustangs. I've never owned a Mustang, actually.

Douglass: Yet!

Rosevear: The Ford guys keep trying to get me to buy one but. But, anyway! [laughs] That's another story. Hi, Ford guys! There are a bunch of things going on here. Let me talk about a few of them.

First of all, Ford is shifting its business. It's reducing investments in places where it hasn't been earning good margins and investing more in places where it feels it has a strength. Crossover SUVs, commercial vehicles, where Ford is a dominant player in the U.S. and Europe, and it's still a strong player in China, even as its overall sales have diminished. And, performance. If you think that looks like a Ford Mustang, you're partly right. The Mustang is a very profitable product, and it's not going anywhere no matter where car sales go. But, also, performance versions of other vehicles. They're doing a performance version of the Edge crossover, which is a new thing and a different thing and they're trying it to see how it works. Those packages deliver good margins and they create excitement among buyers. People come to the dealers to see them, they consider them. People who buy them are enthusiastic about Ford. They are good business cases for performance vehicles.

That's happening. Bob thinks that 2018 in retrospect will turn out to probably be the trough. As they revamp the product lineups in China and shift gears in Europe and cut unprofitable product lines and so forth and so on, all of this stuff going on all at the same time. That's happening, and things will look better in a few years.

They're also investing, of course, what is -- when we're talking about double-digit billions -- not anything like that, but still real money, serious money, in self-driving and electric vehicles. Those are all coming and will turn, instead of consumers of cash, into revenue and profit generators sometime in the first part of the next decade. Stuff looks tough for Ford right now, but they've got a plan, they're actually acting on it, and the plan makes sense and things will probably look better in a few years.

The other part of this is that autos is a cyclical business, as we always say. We're probably a lot closer to the end of the cycle than the beginning. Meaning, at some point, a recession hits. What happens in a recession is, automaker profits get squeezed because they have high fixed costs. If they aren't making as many vehicles, then the margin above those fixed costs starts to shrink quickly. Ford says it'll break even at a U.S. market sales pace of around 10.5 million vehicles a year. It dipped below that for several months during the 2008-2009 recession, but it's got to be pretty bad to get down to that level.

We're moving against that. Part of the issues with Ford's stock price --Ford is cheap right now -- is concerns about where Ford is going, which is starting to become more visible, and it's reassuring as it becomes more visible. It's also partly concerns about where we are in the cycle.

As an investment, I would say, if you are thinking long-term, you could probably do worse than to buy it here, reinvest all those dividends. Since auto stocks tend to rise early in the cycle, on the far side of the next recession, when Ford is trading at $13-16 a share, as it very well may be, start to think about where you are.

Douglass: Yeah, I think that certainly makes a fair amount of sense. I mean, it has been frustrating -- I think you share this frustration -- to watch Ford struggling, even though we're maybe not at the end of the cycle quite yet. This has been, economically, a good last couple of years. So, it's certainly been frustrating to see that.

John, since we've got you on the show, let's go ahead and do a couple of quick hits on some auto news. We said we weren't going to talk about Tesla, and we're not going to talk too much about Tesla. But, of course, there are a lot of Tesla challengers incoming. That picture is also starting to firm up. You and I were chatting before the show, and you listed off -- let me see. Jaguar, Porsche, Volvo , Audi , Mercedes Benz, all launching electric cars sometime between now and the end of 2019.

Rosevear: Yeah, there's a lot coming. We've seen the Jaguar I-Pace. Generally speaking, critics like it a lot. It's in very early production now. Some have been sold in Europe. It will start arriving in the U.S. I think they're saying November of this year. Also coming, Audi has the E-tron Quattro or whatever they're going to call it. It's a mid-sized electric SUV. It's very much a Model X fighter. That is coming early next year. Volvo has a new sub-brand, which is kind of a joint venture with its corporate parent, Chinese automaker Geely, called Polestar. Polestar is going to be bringing out a series of electric vehicles. The Polestar 2, which is said to be coming next year, is an SUV about the size the of the Model 3. It's a crossover. It's a nice, low-slung, all-electric crossover.

Mercedes also has an electric crossover coming next year, the first of several Mercedes Benz electrics that are on the way. They haven't given us a lot of detail about that yet. We've seen a few spy shots. It seems to be in the same size range as if you built an SUV on the Model 3's platform. The much talked-about Tesla Model Y is coming eventually, if Tesla gets its act together.

These are all coming between now and the end of next year. They're all long-range, range comparable to Tesla, premium electric vehicles built by automakers who will not have Tesla's challenges around manufacturing. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.

Douglass: Yes. And unfortunately, from an investing perspective, a little early to pick out winners and losers, until we really start seeing how these cars come out and what those initial sales numbers look like.

Let's talk about GM a little bit. We've talked about Ford, we might as well talk about GM. There's a new pickup line that they're coming after.

Rosevear: We should back up one step and say, GM is turning out great profits.

Douglass: [laughs] GM's doing great, yeah!

Rosevear: They did their whole line of crossover SUVs. There are like nine of them that are all-new since the beginning of 2016, all the way from a little Chevy to a Cadillac. There are a few more in the pipe. They're selling like hotcakes in the U.S., they're selling like hotcakes in China. Some of them are over there, as well. The Cadillac XT5 is doing well in China. The Chevy Equinox is picking up steam in China. They have an affordable SUV that they developed under their Baojun brand, which is a joint venture GM set up to compete with domestic Chinese automakers who sell these low-cost SUVs. The idea is, it's a low-cost Chinese SUV but with global automaker quality. It's selling like crazy in China. They're doing well there. So, they're making their making bank. [laughs] They're doing very well.

Coming up next for them is all-new pickups. These are a big leap ahead, they are saying, from their current pickups. It's all-new from the ground up. Whereas their last new pickups in 2014 were a heavy-duty overhaul of what they'd had before, these are really all-new. They're significantly lighter, they're cheaper to manufacture. They follow the patterns of other GM products in recent years in that they've created more upscale options that they hope will be appealing and expand the overall margins of the truck program. They've had success doing that with the crossovers. The new crossovers, the new Chevy Equinox that came in, is not only nicer in its base version than the older old one by a significant margin, but you can option it up further. That has helped GM's profit margins. Their operating margins have gotten very strong. They're expecting to do the same things with the pickups.

Now, with GM, they launched the full-sized pickups and the mid-sized pickups and the big SUVs that are based on the same frames, the same platforms. Those are things like the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, the GMC Yukon and the Yukon Denali, and then the Cadillac Escalade. Those are all going to be all-new, too. Out probably 18 months from the end of the year. And, the new GMC Canyon and Chevrolet Colorado pickups, which are mid-sizers that compete with the upcoming Ford Ranger, which we'll talk about, too.

GM is doing all of this. It's spending money to do this, but it's making a ton of money from the crossovers, so margins still look pretty good.

Douglass: Yeah. And then, of course, our third quick-hit story, which you teed up there, is that the pricing for the new-to-the-U.S. Ford Ranger pickup was just released.

Rosevear: Well, it wasn't officially released, but Ford made the built-in price tool live on its website. They didn't put out a press release or anything. But there was one day. Starting price on the Ranger is $25,395. That's a rear-wheel drive extended cab XL model. XLT starts at just over $29,000. Then, the top trim for now is going to be a Lariat at $33,300.

These all have the same engine. It's the turbo 2.3-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost with the new 10-speed automatic transmission. You can get it with a shorter bed or a longer bed. You can get super cab, which has a small backseat, and the super crew, which has a conventionally sized backseat. That's a couple of thousand extra. Rear-wheel drive, four-wheel drive. It's not going to have quite the lavish options list that the F-150 does, but it's a Ford truck. There'll be plenty of ways to configure it. You'll be able to get one stripped for $26,000 for your business, or load one up, probably over $40,000 for a nice daily driver that's comfortable and has the good stereo and the leather seats and all that kind of stuff.

Douglass: Fancy. I will be in the car market probably in the next six to nine months, so I think you and I are going to have a few more conversations on or off the podcast. We'll figure that out.

By Antony Currie

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.)

NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chief Executive Elon Musk's abortive buyout dalliance has hurt his credibility - and may result in legal and regulatory censure. Getting the $53 billion company back on the road requires its cozy directors to do more of the driving. Breakingviews imagines the advice a consultant might give Tesla's board.

To Tesla's independent board members,

After Elon dumped his plan to take Tesla private last week, you asked our firm to switch from advising you on a potential deal to laying out what the company should do next. Below please find our initial findings.

The most pertinent lesson of the buyout brouhaha - and, frankly, incidents like Elon calling one of those who rescued the Thai boys' soccer team a pedophile - is that you need to be a far more active and involved board. That doesn't mean you should all be donning overalls and hitting the factory floor, spanners and torque wrenches in hand.

Rather, it's time to get your house - and Elon's - in order. Let's start with the board. It's perceived as being too closely aligned to Elon. Only three of you have no other ties to him. You put Brad Buss, who was finance chief for SolarCity, on the special committee to evaluate any offer Elon might make. And Elon and your lead director, Antonio Gracias, go way back. We strongly recommend you consider making someone else head of the board.

You don't do yourselves any favors, either. For example, you stayed silent about his Thai ""pedo"" tweet. And you waited more than a day to publicly announce the end of a buyout bid, seemingly so that Elon could get his own comments in order. And then you made it seem as if you were trying to bury the news by releasing it just short of midnight New York time. On a Friday. It all reinforces the perception that you're too chummy with Elon.

You can alter that by properly addressing his weaknesses. First, we recommend that you narrow his focus. It may be good for morale to see the boss helping out on the factory floor, but it diverts his attention from running the business. His emotional interview with the New York Times is just the latest evidence that he has spread himself too thin.

Ideally, you should be pushing him to relinquish his leadership roles at SpaceX and the Boring Co - or at least going on furlough until Tesla's ""production hell"" is over and the company is solidly profitable. Hiring a chief operating officer, as SpaceX did, would also help.

Speaking of goals, we further strongly suggest you force Elon to lower his production targets. He has too often overpromised and underdelivered. That has directly contributed not just to his poor mental state. It's also playing a role in mounting quality problems with new Model 3s and a dearth of spare parts and service times for those already on the road. You even have reporters and short sellers, sometimes armed with drones, monitoring the factory lots for evidence production has slowed.

He needs to dial back his financial prognostications, too. Perhaps Tesla will become sustainably profitable in the second half of the year. But the company has burned through $1.8 billion so far this year, has just $2.2 billion in cash on hand and $1.1 billion in debt coming due by March.

It'll probably require a $3 billion improvement in cash generation by the end of December to avoid a calamity. But instead of raising capital to cover any potential shortfall, Elon has spent 2018 playing a dangerous game of chicken.

Many shareholders may be more than willing to help out if you go to them cap in hand again. That was at least one positive takeaway from the buyout fiasco. That of course assumes Tesla is actually able to sell more stock - or bonds - while the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates Elon's Aug. 7 tweets about having ""funding secured.""

These could be goals to put into his compensation package, along with running any and all Tesla-related tweets past compliance and limiting his time working in the factory. Though with Elon it may be more effective simply to threaten to remove him as CEO.

Sure, lowering targets and raising capital may tank the stock. But even if it halved, Tesla would still trade at 17 times 2020 earnings - far higher than any major automaker. And if these measures help make the company, and Elon, more reliable, it ought to be just a bump in the road.

Yours faithfully,

Phil R. Upp

- Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has dropped plans to take the electric-car maker private, the company said late in the evening on Aug. 24, a day after he had informed the board of his decision.

- In a post on the company's blog, Musk said most investors told him ""we are better off as a public company"" and that there was ""no proven path"" for most retail investors to retain stakes in a delisted firm. Additionally, some institutional investors also informed him that they had limits on how much stock in a private company they could hold.

- In the post, Musk admitted that the buyout process would have been ""even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable.""

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/will-us-mexico-trade-dispute-end-finally-cm1013563,"Don't look now, but markets are once again approaching all-time highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, last topping out at 26,616.71 this past January, sees that figure roughly 3% away. Trading strength over the summer months, boosted in large part by another strong earnings season, has poised the index up an additional 142 points in today's pre-market.

Positive sentiment has also emerged over the course of this summer that trade tensions may be relieved sooner than later, and this morning we see another step forward on this front: a new trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico is expected sometime today, following talks which have concluded between the two countries. It's unclear exactly how this will affect the NAFTA agreement signed a quarter-century ago, which would include Canada along with Mexico and the U.S., but even Canada has publicly recognized that the U.S. and its neighbor to the south have relatively greater trade concerns.

Incoming Mexican President Lopez Obrador - the socialist known as AMLO - has expressed he'd like the trade rift between his country and the U.S. behind them by the time he takes office later this year. Some say a new tri-lateral deal for NAFTA overall may be realized by the end of this week, although many see this as a rather tall order. Nevertheless, news of real progress south of the border is adding to positive pre-market sentiment for the first trading day of this week.

Elsewhere, a sigh of relief for fans of a publicly-traded Tesla Corp. TSLA this morning, as the electric car leader and its CEO Elon Musk have expressed the company will not going into private holding, despite an August 7th tweet by Musk that he planned to take the company private once its share price hit $420. This tweet may have triggered an SEC investigation into whether Musk was manipulating his company's stock price by targeting short-sellers.

That said, TSLA shares have fallen 2.3% on the news this morning, notably down from the near-term highs post-tweet, and the auto manufacturer's all-time closing high of $379 roughly 50 weeks ago. Shareholders had overwhelmingly expressed opposition to Musk's public musings about taking his company private, which look to have changed the CEO's mind… at least for now.

(RTTNews.com) - Teresa Goody, the CEO of Goody Group and former SEC general counsel attorney, expects Elon Musk to be haunted by legal issues and investigation from regulators regarding his tweets about taking the company private.

Teresa Goody, speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday, said ""Questions from the SEC are going to continue. With every blog post and with every statement since his initial tweets we have seen admissions from Mr. Musk that basically there was no reasonable basis to believe his tweets were true.""

""What I think the SEC is going to find alarming â€"" as I did when I read the New York Times article, his interview â€"" is the fact the he says, 'Well, I don't regret any of my tweets. Why would I?' Because a lot of people believed you and lost a lot of money,"" said Goody.

On Friday, Musk said he canceled his plan to take Tesla private, after a board meeting.

Tesla's chairman, CEO and largest shareholder said, ""Given the feedback I've received, it's apparent that most of Tesla's existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company."" He also wrote, ""There is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private.

Early this month, Musk surprised the Wall Street by tweeting that he is considering to take Tesla private at $420 per share and the required funding was secured. Later, in a blog post, Musk revealed that a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund had approached him ""multiple times"" about taking Tesla private.

The S&P 500 closed at a record high last week, and was looking to head higher on Monday. Credit reports that the U.S. and Mexico might be close to an agreement on Nafta for the lift, as attention turns to Canada. Tesla, meanwhile, was tumbling after Elon Musk said it won't be going private, after all. In today's Morning Movers, we...

Josh Felise

•...wonder how much higher the market can go; •...highlight a downgrade of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG); •...and explain why United States Steel (X) is tumbling.

Summer is rapidly fading away, but the same can't be said of the market's gains.

S&P 500 futures have advanced 0.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gained 139 points, or 0.5%. Nasdaq Composite futures have risen 0.5%.

With the S&P 500 back at an all-time high, its fair to wonder just how much higher it can go. For Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub, the answer is...much higher. ""Late last year, we set our 2018 price target of 3000, implying a 12% advance,"" he explains. ""Friday's 2875 close represents 7.5% upside in just under 8 months. Looking forward, we believe the market will continue to advance at roughly 1% per month.""

Not everyone is so optimistic, however. The Leuthold Group's Jim Paulsen doesn't see much potential for stocks to head much higher. The reason: There's not much room left for improvement. Valuations are high and probably aren't going higher; investors are feeling pretty good about the market; corporate profits have been incredibly strong; and the economic recovery might be as good as it gets. ""While this does not imply a bear market is imminent, it does focus attention on the bull's remaining potential,"" Paulsen writes. ""Whether it lasts several more years or only a few months, the record-high utilization rate suggests subpar returns in this now'capacity-challenged' bull market.""

My prediction: They're both right.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-tesla-inc-a-buy-cm1013334,"If you're like me, you've probably given up on trying to figure out Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) . The electric car company (and solar panel installer, thanks to its purchase of SolarCity) doesn't seem to play by any of the normal investing rules. Neither does its founder and CEO Elon Musk. Trying to measure the company by the same metrics as, say, conventional automaker General Motors is impossible.

Coverage of some of Musk's more newsworthy statements and of Tesla vehicles' occasional mishaps tend to crowd out other coverage of the company. But if you're trying to figure out whether to buy a stake, you should look past all that. Let's focus on what really matters to see if Tesla is a buy.

Tesla needs to ramp up production of its Model 3 to achieve profitability. Image source: Getty Images.

What doesn't matter

Negative news coverage seems to have more of an immediate impact on Tesla's stock price than just about anything else, even its earnings reports. But none of it seems to stick.

Take, for example, the reports of a fatal Model X crash in California on March 23. The crash occurred on a Friday, and the following Monday, Tesla's stock lost nearly 15% of its value. Less than two weeks later, on April 5, it had gained it all back. Contrast that to when the company reported its biggest-to-date quarterly loss on Feb. 7 and the stock ""only"" lost about 8% of its value. But it still gained it all back again by Feb. 22, about two weeks later.

Even when these events happen in tandem -- for example, Musk's unorthodox remarks on his Q1 earnings call on May 2, in which the company reported more than $1 billion in negative free cash flow -- a predictable pattern emerges: The stock suffers an immediate hit (in this case, just over 5%), and within two weeks it gains it all back.

What this should tell investors is that Tesla's stock moves are pretty much divorced from the company's fundamentals. Look no further than the company's Q2 earnings release, which reported a(nother) record quarterly loss , but caused the stock to jump by about 10%. You can bet that if GM reported its largest-ever quarterly loss, or massive negative free cash flow, the stock would sink, and stay there until the company could prove to investors it was turning things around. Not so Tesla -- and sure enough, about two weeks later on August 20, the stock reverted back to about $300/share (helped along by a New York Times interview with Musk).

Takeaway: Even if you decide Tesla is a losing proposition, you short the stock at your peril.

The writing on the wall

Tesla is, essentially, a rock-star company. It generates tremendous enthusiasm among its followers and tremendous disdain among its detractors. The same applies to Musk. But the problem with this rock-star status is that so much of Tesla's coverage is devoted to big, splashy headlines that don't really matter to the company's bottom line (Musk's Thai ""kid-size"" submarine, for example, or his disparaging Twitter comments about one of the Thai rescuers and subsequent apology). And so, some important information slips through the cracks and gets lost.

For example, in June, Tesla announced it would lay off 9% of its workforce , or about 4,100 people, showing that the company is concerned about its finances. This comes amid a stream of senior executives heading for the exits, including senior vice president of engineering Doug Field and Autopilot division head Jim Keller, which generally isn't a good sign for any company. Finally, even Musk himself, in a letter to employees announcing the layoffs, admitted:

Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us. What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla's history to date.

This is an uncharacteristic statement from Musk, who has often derided critics of his company. It seems to show that Musk knows Tesla needs to start turning a profit -- and soon -- or suffer the consequences. But can it?

The wolves at the door

Musk and Tesla have made, and broken, many promises over the years, from production targets to rollout deadlines. Current promises on the table include:

That Tesla will produce 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company managed that feat in the final week of Q2, according to Musk, by pulling out all the stops. But can it do so week in and week out? That Model 3 gross margin will (eventually) reach 25% or more. But the company is only predicting a 15% gross margin in Q3. That Tesla will not need to raise more capital in 2018. Many analysts are skeptical of this claim , particularly in light of Tesla's billion-dollar-plus negative free cash flow in Q1 2018. That after the current layoffs, Tesla will ""never have to do this [lay off workers] again.""

You probably won't be surprised to hear me say that it's unclear whether Tesla can meet these promises, either in the short term or the long term. An investment in Tesla is largely an investment in Musk's long-term vision, and it may take quite a while to pay off.

But as the deadlines get missed, the production targets get delayed, and the cash continues to flow out the door, competitors are catching up. For example, GM now has the Bolt electric vehicle on the market, and is seeing global demand outstrip supply . Other rival manufacturers are unleashing high-end electric vehicles of their own. These companies have plenty of cash and large research and development budgets, and are well-respected brands in their own right.

Basically, as Musk seems to realize, Tesla needs to put up or shut up on its promises.

At these prices

Given its lofty share price -- as of this writing, about $320/share -- combined with real concerns about profitability, margins, production, competition, ""brain drain,"" and finances, I can't call Tesla a buy, particularly as much of this seems to be coming to a head.

What gives me pause is how little any of this has mattered to Tesla's stock performance in the past. It's possible more bad news will emerge about Tesla and its stock will rise even further. Or that it will report some favorable news and the stock will go down. Either way, if history is any guide, shares may revert to the mean in two weeks.

One thing's for sure: An investment in Tesla at these prices is a risk. If you want to take the gamble, make sure it's with money you can afford to lose.

LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - European auto shares surged morethan 2 percent on Monday as news of a U.S.-Mexico agreement onNAFTA added to the bullish sentiment generated by U.S. FederalReserve chairman Jerome Powell's market-friendly speech.

A British public holiday thinned trading volumes across theregion but European markets opened broadly firmer after Powelllate last week affirmed the U.S. central bank's current gradualpace of rate hikes. The comments sent Wall Street to recordhighs on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump had suggested earlier on Mondaythat the United States and Mexico were close to a ""big deal"" urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nS0N1UT021.

The euro stocks index .STOXXE as well as Germany's DAX .GDAXI touched 2-1/2-week highs, with the former closing 0.9percent higher and the latter riding 1.2 percent higher on theback of the auto rally.

Car shares enjoyed their best day in a month .SXAP withgains of 2.2 percent. German carmakers, especially, rely onsmooth trade between Mexico and the U.S. to sell vehicles madein Mexican plants into the U.S. market. ""The biggest risks the market were discounting were tradewars, so any reduction in trade war risk such as NAFTA talks oreven Trump trying to find bilateral deals, has pushed U.S.shares to new records and will support markets,"" said AngeloMeda, head of equities and portfolio manager at Banor SIM inMilan.

BMWBMWG.DE , VolkswagenVOWG_p.DE , PorschePCHG_p.DE and Daimler DAIGn.DE rose 2.5 to 3.0 percent.

However, also in auto news, the Germany-listed shares ofU.S. electric carmaker Tesla TSLA.TG fell almost 4 percent onthe Tradegate exchange. Tesla's U.S. shares dipped around 3.3percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk called off a bid to takethe company private. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL8N1VI0SK

Equinor, which has a 40 percent stake in the field, gained1.2 percent.

The easing of trade tensions should be good news for theSTOXX 600 .STOXX which is down 1.2 percent year-to-date due topolitical developments in Italy and Turkey.

Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB underperformed rivals, rising just0.3 percent.

""The only cloud on the horizon is Italy,"" Meda added. ""Thefeeling I have is nobody has any will to take any risk in thenext couple of weeks before we get more clarity on the budget.""

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) announced it’s staying public. We were wrong in thinking there was a 2/3 chance that Tesla goes private.

) announced it’s staying public. We were wrong in thinking there was a 2/3 chance that Tesla goes private. We continue to believe Tesla would create more value as a private company. That said we believe shares of TSLA are undervalued given the company’s position in EVs, autonomy, and renewable energy.

The company cited three primary reasons for staying public: current TSLA investors’ limits on private investment, no path for retail investors to invest, and the process would be a distraction from ramping Model 3 production.

A fourth unstated reason may have been collateral damage from the recent media interactions of Musk and a perception from potential go private investors that he may be difficult to work with. We still think there is work for Musk to do to rebuild that trust in the market.

There is a silver lining, as Musk pointed out in the blog post, that this will allow him to fully focus on Model 3 production as he should be able to hand off most of the work related to the class action issues to his legal team.

These reasons will put further scrutiny on Musk’s August 7th “funding secured” comment.

We expect class action lawsuits against Musk around “funding secured” could linger for a year.

We expect Musk to continue to lead Tesla regardless of any outcome from the class action lawsuits.

We don’t know what level of personal liability Musk will be exposed to related to “funding secured” but note while the comment may seem clear (i.e. I have all of the money to take Tesla private), it is open to legal interpretation.

We believe Tesla will be insulated from any claims given the company has made it clear that “go private” is an Elon Musk initiative.

We expect a small fine from NASDAQ related to the failure to notify the exchange of pending material news from the August 7th go private tweets.

S&P, Nasdaq hit records as Wall St rises on NAFTA optimism



By Shreyashi Sanyal

Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted strong gains on Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs, as news that the United States and Mexico were closing in on a trade deal added to optimism about the economy.

A Mexican source familiar with the talks told Reuters ""it's almost certain"" that there will be an announcement about the North American Free Trade Agreement later in the day and U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, ""a big deal looking good with Mexico!""

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. The top gainer was the materials sector with a 1.38 percent increase, as prices of metals and gold rose. The trade-sensitive industrials sector was up about 0.82 percent.

Boeing and Caterpillar rose 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Shares of automakers Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler were up between 1.86 percent and 2.26 percent.

""What we are seeing is optimism that there is going to be some resolution to trade difficulties and then there's the news of the U.S. and Mexico closing in on the NAFTA deal,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

""Easing trade and NAFTA are probably the biggest things today but I think it's more fundamental than that, because we're still seeing a lot of signs of strength in the domestic economy and earnings stories have been very robust.""

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank's gradual interest rate hikes were the best way to protect the economic recovery, maintain strong job growth and keep inflation under control.

In a ruling on Monday, Judge Frederick Myers of Ontario struck down the transition program set up by the new Ontario government, which excluded Tesla customers from qualifying for rebates.

A Tesla spokeswoman welcomed the decision.

“Tesla only sought fair treatment for our customers and we hope the Ministry now does the right thing by delivering on its promise to ensure all [electric vehicle]-owners receive their incentives,” the spokeswoman said in an email on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for Ontario’s Attorney-General said the government is reviewing the ruling “and will make a decision on how to proceed in the coming days.”

Tesla’s challenge arose after Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government in July canceled a slew of green energy initiatives, including an Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Incentive Program that provided rebates of up to C$14,000 ($10,640) for people who bought electric cars.

Premier Doug Ford’s government, which came to power the previous month, made provisions for people who had already bought or ordered cars but structured the transition program in such a way as to exclude Tesla, which does not use franchised dealerships.

In challenging the program, Tesla called this an “arbitrary” exclusion.

Myers agreed, calling the exclusion “arbitrary” and “egregious” in his ruling, in part “because the (Transportation) Minister singled out Tesla for reprobation and harm” without providing the company a chance to be heard.",2018-08-28,Tesla

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s take-private plans for Tesla Inc have evaporated, but the company’s looming debt needs remain.

With a debt load of about $10.5 billion and the possibility of an impending cash shortfall, Wall Street expects the luxury electric carmaker may need to raise funds before long.

Tesla Chief Executive Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion take-private deal, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and may draw regulatory scrutiny.

None of that has done anything to help it with a looming issue: cash.

Tesla, which has had just one quarter of positive free cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2013, has $1.3 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. Meanwhile it has just $1.3 billion of cash on hand after backing out $942 million of customer deposits on cars.

With analysts forecasting a slowed, but continued, cash burn in the second half of 2018, Tesla may need to borrow up to $2 billion by the end of the year to stay afloat.

In response to a request for comment, a Tesla representative referred to Musk’s statement on the company’s second-quarter earnings call when he said the company planned to pay its convertible debt with internally generated cash flow.

DEBT RAISING

The most likely option, according to analysts, is a convertible debt issue. Musk has historically favored convertible bonds to raise capital, and Tesla and its SolarCity unit each have three issues of convertible senior notes, worth a total of $4.2 billion.

Convertibles give owners the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. They allow holders to benefit from a rising share price, while also offering bond-like protection if it falls.

The one challenge of using more convertible debt, however, is “that it drives more short sellers to your stock. And Musk does not want that,” said Jeffrey Osborne, senior research analyst, Cowen Inc.

Frequently, convertible bond owners will hedge their positions by selling the underlying stock short. Moreover, the dilution caused by conversion could also pressure a stock, drawing the interest of short sellers.

Of the $1.3 billion Tesla has coming due in the next 12 months, $230 million is from a SolarCity convertible due on Nov. 1, and another $920 million from a Tesla convertible due on March 1, 2019. Tesla’s shares, at $319.27, are a long way from the $560.64 needed to convert the SolarCity debt but have traded above the $359.87 March 2019 debt conversion price.

Musk could also choose to offer convertible bond investors the opportunity to exchange their debt for equity below either or both strike prices, although that could require some assurances on the company’s fundamentals.

STRAIGHT DEBT

Tesla could issue straight debt akin to the 5.3 percent coupon junk bond coming due in 2025. That bond however, is trading well below par at 87.13 cents on the dollar, and so it would be unlikely that Tesla could get the sort of favorable terms they secured in their last offering.

Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, which is among Tesla’s top 10 bondholders, said that the level of scrutiny Musk would have to go through “would be meaningfully higher in any new issuance.”

EQUITY

Equity markets have historically been friendly to Tesla, however Musk said, on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, that he would not tap them for cash. “We’ll not be raising any equity at any point... I have no expectation of doing so; do not plan to do so.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into Musk for potentially misleading investors when he tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a $420 a share take-private deal, according to media reports.

LEASE/ASSET-BACKED SECURITY DEAL

Tesla could securitize automotive leases backed by drivers’ monthly payments as it did earlier this year when it sold $546 million of bonds backed by leases on Model S and Model X cars.

There are two problems with issuing new asset-backed securities.

The first is that old vehicles may not sell for as much as expected given the increasing competition Tesla is facing in the electric vehicle space. Second, leases as a percentage of vehicles sold have fallen dramatically as it is not possible to lease a Model 3 sedan. While roughly 20 percent to 30 percent of Model S and Model Xs were leased, the Model 3 must be paid for in cash.",2018-08-28,

In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said that while shareholders claimed that Tesla fell short of its production goals, “federal securities laws do not punish companies for failing to achieve their targets.”

Breyer said the shareholders have until Sept. 28 to amend their complaint. Their lawyer, Laurence Rosen, did not respond to a request for comment.

The case is separate from lawsuits accusing Tesla and Musk of scheming to hurt short-sellers through Musk’s Aug. 7 tweets about taking the Palo Alto, California-based company private, and that funding had been “secured.”

Musk abandoned that proposal late Friday night.

Tesla formally launched the Model 3 in July 2017, touting it as a vehicle for the masses, and attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.

But shareholders said Musk knew Tesla was “woefully unprepared” to meet its production goal of 5,000 Model 3s per week, and that Tesla’s share price was inflated until after the company finally cut its production target last November.

Belief in the Model 3 had helped propel Tesla’s share price 62 percent higher in the 1-1/2 years after the Palo Alto, California-based company unveiled it in March 2016.

But the judge said shareholders failed to show that Tesla needed to be clearer that Model 3 production could fall short.

The company eventually blamed its production shortfall on “bottlenecks” at its battery factory outside Reno, Nevada and its assembly plant in Fremont, California.

“Plaintiffs are correct that defendants’ qualifications would not have been meaningful if defendants had known that it was impossible for Tesla to meet its stated production goals, not merely highly unlikely,” Breyer wrote. “The facts plaintiffs have put forth do not tend to establish that this was the case.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breyer’s decision is dated Aug. 24.

https://reuters.com//article/us-tesla-musk-stocks/tesla-shares-dip-3-percent-after-musk-abandons-buyout-idUSKCN1LC0CA,"(Reuters) - Shares in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell just under 3 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk abandoned his plan to take the electric carmaker private, with analysts saying the company needed new blood among senior management to prop up its standing with investors.

The billionaire entrepreneur said in a blog post late on Friday that consultations, done with the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had shown most of Tesla’s existing shareholders opposed the deal that he proposed on Twitter three weeks ago to widespread shock on Wall Street.

“We are hopeful that ... the past 17 days will lead the Board down the path to bringing on a more operational CEO or at a minimum a COO,” Cowen and Co analysts said in a note to clients.

Tesla’s shares, already down nearly 15 percent from a peak on Aug. 7 when Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a buyout at $420 a share, initially fell more than 5 percent in European and premarket trading in New York.

They recovered, however, to stand down just 2.8 percent lower at $314 by 8.30 e.t..

Notes from Wall Street analysts questioned Musk’s credibility going forward in the face of a possible investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the factual accuracy of an Aug. 7 tweet that funding for the buyout deal was “secured”.

“Musk’s involvement in the company is critical, but now more than ever a solid #2 - someone with strong operational background that can help Tesla move from ideas to execution - is crucial,” analyst Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note.

Tesla said on Sunday it was not searching for a chief operating officer.

“While we are always looking for highly talented executives (...) there is no active COO search,” a spokesman said by email.

With Musk’s idea for a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund now off the table, attention was zeroing in on Tesla’s efforts to become profitable, its cash reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital.

Tesla had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718 million loss.

Slideshow (2 Images)

In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more cash.

A Tesla spokesman on Sunday also referred back to those previous comments.

“With its long term mission intact but short term growth shaky, serious gaps in execution skills and a board under pressure for not assuming its duties, now may be the time for third parties to get involved, be it from technology or even oil,” Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois told clients.

One of Tesla’s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.

Monday’s fall would still leave shares in the company 27 percent above a low of $244.59 hit on April 2, a day before the electric carmaker released its production and Model 3 deliveries report for the first quarter.

TAPPING CAPITAL MARKETS

Investors in Tesla’s bonds and convertible debt had also already shown skepticism that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize, unconvinced by Musk’s tweet or subsequent blog post in which he could only make the case for going private and not list clear backing.

Analysts have suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence but investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend it would also contradict Musk’s promise that Tesla is adequately funded.

This week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday.

https://reuters.com//article/us-tesla-musk-governance/musks-u-turn-on-tesla-deal-could-intensify-his-legal-regulatory-woes-idUSKCN1LB0OE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk’s decision to abruptly abandon a plan to take his electric carmaker private will not resolve his mounting regulatory and legal woes, and may even make them worse, some securities lawyers said.

Explaining his reversal in a late-night blog post on Friday, the billionaire CEO said that taking the company private “would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,” and that “most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.”

It was on Aug. 7 that Musk first surprised investors with his plan by tweeting that he had “funding secured” for a go-private deal, which would have had a value of $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: “Investor support is confirmed.” [L2N1VG01J]

Musk and Tesla are facing investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the truthfulness of the CEO’S Aug. 7 tweets, according to an Aug. 8 report by the Wall Street Journal.

The SEC declined to confirm that report to Reuters. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.

“The SEC will continue its investigation until it’s satisfied that it is on top of the facts,” said Stephen Crimmins, an attorney with Murphy & McGonigle who spent 14 years at the SEC, where he prosecuted hundreds of securities cases.

“What happened on Friday will be of interest to the SEC because it will allow them to probe whether Musk’s pulling back from the go-private somehow indicates that he did not have a reasonable basis for his statement. They will be asking questions of him and others involved in the decision as to why he reversed course.”

Musk has stuck to his original statement that he believed a deal was possible, and one person familiar with the discussions told Reuters that Musk was serious about taking the carmaker private.

But acting in good faith may not be enough to help Musk escape the regulator’s gaze.

U.S. securities law requires public company executives to have a “reasonable basis” on which to make representations to the investing public, and that would likely be the focus of an SEC probe, said three securities lawyers.

It remains unclear what Musk meant by “funding secured.” In an Aug. 13 statement, Musk said that he left a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund “with no question that a deal ... could be closed.”

The Saudi fund had earlier acquired a just-below 5 percent stake in Tesla on the open market. But the fund has made no comment on whether it had promised to back a much larger Tesla go-private deal.

‘FUNDING SECURED’

Musk said on Friday he believed there was plenty of potential funding to take the company private, but he did not provide any further details to bolster his “funding secured” assertion.

Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said Musk’s statement on Friday appeared to undermine his Aug. 7 tweet that investor support was confirmed.

She also raised concerns about a second comment Musk made on Friday, where he said it had become apparent that compliance restrictions would prevent many of Tesla’s institutional shareholders from holding private Tesla equity.

Both statements are likely to raise further questions among SEC officials as to whether Musk had performed sufficient due diligence to have had a reasonable basis for his Aug. 7 tweets, she said.

Another statement in the blog that could catch the eye of SEC officials is Musk’s reference to his discussion with Tesla’s board on Thursday, during which both parties decided not to pursue the deal, said M. Ridgway Barker, a partner and chair of the corporate finance practice at law firm Withersworldwide.

Such discussions are unlikely to be subject to legal privilege and the SEC could subpoena minutes of the meeting, he said.

“If the board discussion included that the deal is not financeable, or prohibitively expensive, that is going to cast further doubt over Musk’s claims,” he said.",2018-08-27,Tesla
https://reuters.com//article/tesla-musk-stocks/update-4-tesla-shares-dip-3-pct-after-musk-abandons-buyout-idUSL2N1VI03J,"(Reuters) - Shares in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell just under 3 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk abandoned his plan to take the electric carmaker private, with analysts saying the company needed new blood among senior management to prop up its standing with investors.

The billionaire entrepreneur said in a blog post late on Friday that consultations, done with the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had shown most of Tesla’s existing shareholders opposed the deal that he proposed on Twitter three weeks ago to widespread shock on Wall Street.

“We are hopeful that ... the past 17 days will lead the Board down the path to bringing on a more operational CEO or at a minimum a COO,” Cowen and Co analysts said in a note to clients.

Tesla’s shares, already down nearly 15 percent from a peak on Aug. 7 when Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a buyout at $420 a share, initially fell more than 5 percent in European and premarket trading in New York.

They recovered, however, to stand down just 2.8 percent lower at $314 by 8.30 e.t..

Notes from Wall Street analysts questioned Musk’s credibility going forward in the face of a possible investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the factual accuracy of an Aug. 7 tweet that funding for the buyout deal was “secured”.

“Musk’s involvement in the company is critical, but now more than ever a solid #2 - someone with strong operational background that can help Tesla move from ideas to execution - is crucial,” analyst Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note.

Tesla said on Sunday it was not searching for a chief operating officer.

“While we are always looking for highly talented executives (...) there is no active COO search,” a spokesman said by email.

With Musk’s idea for a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund now off the table, attention was zeroing in on Tesla’s efforts to become profitable, its cash reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital.

Tesla had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718 million loss.

In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more cash.

A Tesla spokesman on Sunday also referred back to those previous comments.

“With its long term mission intact but short term growth shaky, serious gaps in execution skills and a board under pressure for not assuming its duties, now may be the time for third parties to get involved, be it from technology or even oil,” Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois told clients.

One of Tesla’s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.

Monday’s fall would still leave shares in the company 27 percent above a low of $244.59 hit on April 2, a day before the electric carmaker released its production and Model 3 deliveries report for the first quarter.

TAPPING CAPITAL MARKETS

Investors in Tesla’s bonds and convertible debt had also already shown skepticism that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize, unconvinced by Musk’s tweet or subsequent blog post in which he could only make the case for going private and not list clear backing.

Analysts have suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence but investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend it would also contradict Musk’s promise that Tesla is adequately funded.

This week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday.

“We see the company raising $2 billion in 4Q18, through convertible debt, which may prove a challenge if there still is an ongoing SEC case open,” Cowen and Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a client note.

The high price investors have put on Tesla’s shares has allowed Musk to expand U.S. production, invest in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company burned cash.

Chicago, IL -August 29, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: FacebookFB , NetflixNFLX , AmazonAMZN , GoogleGOOGL and TwitterTWTR .

Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

What's Next for Facebook One Month After Its Historic Decline

It has been roughly one month since Facebook reported second-quarter financial results that sent many investors running. So let's evaluate Facebook since its infamous July 25 earnings release.

User Growth Woes

Facebook saw its second-quarter revenues soar by 42% to hit $13.23 billion, while its quarterly earnings jumped by 32%. Both were impressive for a company making that kind of money. But investors didn't care about Facebook's strong top and bottom line expansion because of its slowing user growth.

Mark Zuckerberg's company saw its daily active user totals in Europe fall from 282 million in Q1 to 279 million. Facebook also experienced a sequential decline in terms of monthly active users in this key region. Meanwhile, Facebook saw its DAUs climb by just about 1% in the U.S. and Canada to close the quarter with 185 million. Plus, at 241 million, MAU's were also flat from Q1 and up only 2% from the year-ago quarter.

It is worth noting that Facebook expanded both its MAU and DAUs in its Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of the World"" regions. However, this growth did little to calm investors since the U.S., Canada, and Europe generated roughly 72% of FB's total Q2 revenues, while only making up approximately 28% of Facebook's total monthly active users.

Clearly, investors and Facebook don't want to see its user totals start to plateau in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Luckily, the firm still offers advertisers access to consumers that are harder and harder to reach during the age of Netflix, Amazon Prime, and increasingly decentralized media. Therefore, Facebook and Google will likely continue to grab a huge chunk of total U.S. ad dollars, which is vital to the company that makes nearly 99% of its revenues from advertising.

But the bad news didn't stop at the company's slowing user growth, which is inevitable for a company that boasts 2.23 billion MAUs. Facebook's CFO David Wehner-in a moment he might now regret- said that the company expects its operating margins will fall into the ""mid-30s on a percentage basis"" over the next several years. The executive also noted that Facebook expects its ""total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019.""

Wehner's operating margin projection, more than anything else, might have caused the massive post-earnings release selloff. The truly scary part for investors is that Facebook posted an operating margin of 44% in Q2, which was already down from 47% in the prior-year quarter.

""Fake News"" Problem

Facebook noted that major investments in augmented and virtual reality as well as marketing and content acquisition will contribute to its declining profitability. The firm's CFO also said that spending on safety and security is set to surge. In fact, ""safety, security and privacy"" was one of the first things that Zuckerberg spoke about on FB's Q2 conference call.

The company hopes to make its platform more transparent and limit the spreading of misinformation, which became a huge point of contention that forced Facebook's CEO to testify in front of members of Congress earlier this year.

Looking Ahead

Facebook suffered the largest-ever one-day loss in market value for a U.S.-listed company following its quarterly earnings release in late July. Shares of FB plummeted 19% in one day, which erased roughly $119 billion market cap.

Investors will notice that Facebook stock has hardly recovered since its huge drop off despite news that it is actively trying to enter new potential growth areas. Facebook reportedly has been in talks with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup to see if the banking giants would be open to partnerships to help increase user engagement.

Facebook, along with Twitter and other social media companies, has added more live video offerings, which might prove vital as a growing number of people and even governments become more concerned about cellphone addiction. Facebook needs to be able to offer users more than the ability to endlessly scroll through posts, which live video, from news to sports, could provide.

Outlook

Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Facebook's third-quarter revenues to jump 34% to reach $13.83 billion. FB's revenues are projected to hit $55.46 billion in fiscal 2018, which would mark over a 36% climb. Meanwhile, Facebook's adjusted Q3 earnings are expected to sink nearly 7%.

Facebook's earnings estimate revision activity has also trended almost completely downward for Q3 and for fiscal 2018 and 2019, over the last 60 days, which helps give Facebook its current Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) standing. Investors might want to stay away from FB stock at the moment since it wouldn't be surprising to see further declines.

Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies

It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/can-google-facebook-twitter-survive-trumps-wrath-cm1014773,"On Aug 28, President Donald Trump took to Twitter, slamming Alphabet, Inc.'s GOOGL Google that Google News prioritized negative coverage and rigging search results against conservatives. Moreover, he also warned other social media platforms like Facebook, Inc. FB and Twitter, Inc. TWTR of rigging results and giving preference to negative news stories about him. However, the claims have been dismissed by online search experts.

That said, this isn't the first time that Trump has targeted tech and media companies. He had earlier expressed his dislike for Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN , more so because of its CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns Washington Post that has been critical of the President and his policies. Interestingly, every time Trump has accused these tech companies, their shares have declined straight away. However, the accusations are unlikely to have any significant long-term effect on companies given that tech stocks have been driving markets for while now.

Trump Takes on Google, Facebook, Twitter

On Aug 28, Trump targeted search engine giant Google and social media platforms Facebook and Twitter at the Oval Office, stating that these companies are ""Treading on very, very troubled territory"" after earlier in the day accusing the search giant of rigging results to prioritize negative coverage and left-leaning outlets. The President had earlier tweeted: ""Google search results for ""Trump News"" shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media."" In another tweet he said: ""This is a very serious situation - will be addressed!""

In response, Google issued a statement claiming that its searches are designed to give users relevant answers. Trump's accessions follow his Aug 24 tweet where he claimed that ""Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people."" Understandably, Trump doesn't like the search results Google shows and considers them to be bad.

However, the bigger picture is somewhat different. It isn't that Google, Facebook and Twitter are the only ones to have drawn Trump's ire, the entire familiar media falls under the ""Fake News Media"" umbrella. Google has been one of the key players in driving Nasdaq's performance this year. However, Trump's tweets immediately brought the company's shares under pressure, declining 0.9%. Also, shares of Facebook and Twitter declined 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively, on Tuesday.

Tech, Media Companies Are Trump's Soft Targets

A number of companies have drawn Trump's ire since his election. However, tech and media companies have been slammed by him the most. Earlier this year, Trump had taken on Amazon. On Mar 28, news website Axios reported that Trump wants to take on the company's growing powers and tax treatment.

Trump's dislike for Amazon can be traced back to his bitterness toward Bezos, who also owns Washington Post that has often criticized the President and his policies. Trump has often attacked Washington Post and on one occasion, misleadingly referred to it as ""Amazon Washington Post."" Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

In March 2017, Trump had attacked ABC News, owned by The Walt Disney Company DIS , with a tweet: ""Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!""

Price Performance: Year to Date

Like many other companies, tech and media giants have often been Trump's targets. Interestingly, following Trump's first attack, shares of most of these companies took a hit. Amazon's shares plummeted almost 5% on Mar 28, erasing $30 billion of its market capitalization. However, Trump's threats so far haven't had any significant effect on the tech and media companies in the long term.

In fact, tech companies have been driving markets for a while and have been one of the best performers so far this year. Shares of Amazon, Google and Twitter have gained 65.3%, 18.3% and 47.9% on a year-to-date basis. Facebook, however, is one of the rare tech giants whose shares have declined 0.1% year to date. However, that is mainly because the company earlier this year got embroiled in a data misuse scandal and reported stagnating user growth in its last quarterly results.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-grubhub-is-a-better-growth-stock-than-starbucks-cm1014558,"Searching for a growth stock in the food industry? It's never been tougher to do. While Amazon 's purchase of Whole Foods is already putting pressure on the grocery industry's razor-thin margins, the fast-casual niche has had an awful run lately as well.

Historically, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been able to buck the trend -- returning over 1,400% between early 2009 and mid-2015. But the times are a-changing, and things don't look so good for Starbucks. That's why I believe growth investors would do better to put their money behind GrubHub (NYSE: GRUB) . Yes, the company behind that delivery app you pull up when going out seems like too much of a task.

Millennials love the concept, but not big names

It's hard to believe, but back in the early 1990s, coffee houses weren't really a ""thing"" in the United States. Sure, Dunkin' Brands offered a place to get your caffeine -- as did most restaurants -- but the idea of a ""third place"" to gather outside home and work was completely foreign.

Perhaps that's why -- according to Statista -- there were only 1,650 independent coffee houses in America in 1991. But then, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz took a trip to Italy, realized the cultural significance of coffee houses and a gaping hole in America's social landscape, and used his coffee houses to fill it .

That approach, and the consistency behind the experience of the brand, made Starbucks a wildly popular option for over 20 years. You knew exactly what you could get there, and the ambiance made it a unique option for a meeting place.

But with that success came copycats: between 1991 and 2015, the number of independent coffee houses increased 1,900% to over 31,000 locations nationwide.

And that's bad news for Starbucks. Here's why: As former hedge-fund manager Mike Alkin pointed out in a January conference , millennials are becoming the dominant consumers, and they're looking for three things when it comes to their goods:

When possible, that it is organic.

That it is made or sourced by local means.

That it comes from a small vendor.

Critically, millennials are willing to pay up for such things. While Starbucks can certainly offer its fair share of organic coffee, the chain -- by its very definition -- isn't ""local"" or ""small."" That's where the 31,000 other coffee stores come into play.

In the world of investing, the most important thing to examine is a company's moat , or sustainable competitive advantage. Starbucks' key moat -- as well as for most other consumer products -- is its brand. Sadly for the company, that brand is losing its power stateside. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the company's comparable-store sales (comps). As you can see below, were it not for price increases, worldwide comps would actually be negative right now.

Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. 2018 figures are for first three fiscal quarters of the year.

To an extent, falling comps are to be expected when a company reaches Starbucks' size. But the fact that traffic in the store has gone negative is a telling sign that the company's brand -- its only real moat -- may not be as strong as some believe.

If the stock were trading in a reasonable range, that would be OK. But as it stands right now, shares trade for 26 times free cash flow, which is a growth stock valuation for a company that is demonstrably -- in terms of comps -- having trouble with growth.

The key that makes GrubHub a better growth choice

You might look at GrubHub and think: ""It doesn't do anything special. At least Starbucks makes something.""

And you wouldn't be wrong. But the difference between Starbucks and GrubHub moving forward comes down to one thing: GrubHub has a much more powerful moat: the network effect . Namely, as more people join a platform, the platform becomes stronger.

GrubHub's value proposition is simple: It offers a way for restaurants to streamline their carryout and delivery service, without needing to hire IT experts or invest in the technology to do so in-house. It also offers delivery services in select markets.

But the bottom line for investors is this: Ihe more customers join GrubHub, the more restaurants are incentivized to join the platform. And the more restaurants that join the platform, the more customers are incentivized to join. It's a virtuous cycle. And as you can see below, the network effect is in full swing.

Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. 2018 figures represent data from end of company's second fiscal quarter.

Granted, some of this growth has come via acquisition , but it only further cements GrubHub's leading position and the strength of its network effects. But here are some other achievements to chew on that occurred over the same time frame:

The number of restaurants listing on GrubHub has more than doubled, from 30,000 in 2013 to over 85,000 today.

The number of daily average orders has nearly quadrupled, to 430,000 in the most recent quarter.

To be sure, GrubHub has a growth stock's valuation -- trading at 73 times trailing free cash flow. Unlike Starbucks, however, GrubHub's underlying business is growing like a growth stock -- the company posted year-over-year revenue growth of 50% last quarter. As the company locks up more and more restaurants and customers, it will gain leverage and pricing power -- something that can have magical effects on compounding investor returns.

While I don't yet own shares of GrubHub, it's on my short list of potential buys. I've already given the company an outperform rating on my All-Star CAPS profile (and given Starbucks an underperform rating). I think if you're looking for growth stocks in this industry, the power of GrubHub's network effect makes it an excellent choice. Those millennials can still buy from their small, local, organic restaurants using GrubHub; increasingly, that's an important dynamic.

Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open flat on Wednesday, with trade squarely in focus as investors awaited progress on trade talks between the United States and Canada and eyed next week's deadline for consultations on fresh China-U.S. tariffs.

After the United States and Mexico announced a bilateral deal on Monday, U.S.-Canada are working to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement amid signs Ottawa was open to taking a more conciliatory approach.

""Investors will continue to concentrate on trade talks now with Canada, and the enthusiasm will continue until we get some concrete news on whether or not the U.S. and Canada reach a deal,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

""It looks like we are headed for another mixed to positive session much like yesterday's but with lighter trading volume, but any positive comments on trade might contribute to a stronger upwards move,"" Cardillo added.

Among stocks, Amazon.com gained 1.1 percent trading premarket and Alphabet rose 0.5 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on both stocks to become the most bullish Wall Street brokerage on the so-called FANG members.

At 8:40 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 20 points, or 0.08 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.25 points, or 0.04 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.05 percent.

The benchmark S&P 500 index has hit record highs for three sessions in a row, but eked out a gain on Tuesday as investors looked beyond Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments and the U.S.-Mexico trade deal.

U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years, as businesses boosted spending on software and imports declined, data from the Commerce Department showed.

Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled 8.1 percent as the sportswear retailer's quarterly same-store sales fell more than expected.

The company blamed tighter controls on gun sales and weak sales of Under Armour products, which pushed shares of the sportswear maker down 3.8 percent.

However, footwear retailer Shoe Carnival jumped 14.3 percent after it beat quarterly profit estimates. Express Inc jumped 7.6 percent after the apparel retailer beat profit estimates and raised its full-year forecast.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise was up 2.2 percent after the IT products and services provider topped revenue and profit estimates.

By Ceyda Caglayan and Matthias Inverardi

ISTANBUL/DUSSELDORF, Aug 29 (Reuters) - German consumer electronics retailer MediaMarkt has suspended plans to buy shares in Turkey's Teknosa, two sources close to the matter said, after recent falls in the lira hit profits of Turkish firms.

Shares in Teknosa tumbled 17.6 percent to 3.84 lira on the news, while the main share index was 0.58 percent lower.

""MediaMarkt has suspended the plans due to recent foreign exchange volatility. It will review the valuation of Teknosa and decide later to go ahead with the acquisition or not,"" the source said, adding a decision may not be reached until October.

Another source confirmed the negotiations were stalled, but said they were not completely cancelled.

MediamarktSaturn, which owns MediaMarkt, declined to comment. Teknosa and parent Sabanci Holding did not immediately respond to questions about the issue.

The sources did not specify the size of the stake MediaMarkt was seeking. Sabanci Holding owns just over 60 percent of Teknosa. Another 10 percent is held by Sabanci family members, and the rest are free floating shares.

Ceconomy, the parent company of MediaMarkt and MediaMarktSaturn said in a quarterly report two weeks ago that the weak lira had weighed on sales in Turkey.

Turkey's electronic goods market was valued at 54 billion lira at the end of 2017, 16 percent up from the previous year, Teknosa said in its annual report.

Despite continued growth potential on the back of Turkey's young population, however, several firms have already downsized or closed because of intense competition and the steady erosion of the lira even before this year's 40 percent slide.

That fall in the currency has caused unease among other companies planning Turkish investments. Japanese firm Toyo Ink postponed plans this week for a polymers plant in Turkey, while retailer Amazon also pushed back its entry into Turkish markets.

Britain-based Electroworld and French company Darty have in past years left the Turkish market, selling their stores to Bimeks, while Germany's Electronic Partner and U.S. electronics giant Best Buy sold out to Teknosa.

Those exits left MediaMarkt as the only international electronics company active in the country. Domestically, Teknosa, Bimeks and Vatan are the leading actors in the sector.

Bimeks however has slashed the number of stores in Turkey to just six from 130 at the end of 2016. Teknosa shut 70 stores in 2016, leaving it with 207 across the country now, and declared losses of 10 million lira in the first half of this year.

While MediaMarkt Turkey does not disclose its revenue, Chief Executive Officer Yenal Gokyildirim has said it grew 30 percent and opened 12 new stores across the country in 2017. MediaMarkt had 68 stores in Turkey at the end of June, according the parent company's quarterly report.

In March, Gokyildirim said Turkey, along with Germany and Spain, was driving the company's sales growth and that MediaMarkt aimed to expand activities in the Turkish market.

(AMZN) likely was helped by strong institutional demand for the stock. Amazon is growing at a tremendous rate even with a nearly $1 trillion market cap. The company is firing on all cylinders and continues to show solid growth with its dominance in the cloud.

Even with terrific fundamentals, the true tell on the near-term trajectory of the stock lies in the trading activity. At many points in 2018, Amazon shares have increased in price alongside an increase in volume. This can be indicative of smart money accumulating shares. The bottom line here is that the manner in which a stock trades can oftentimes alert you to the forward fundamental picture more so than simply looking at a company's financials alone. (For more, see: Amazon to Hit $2.5 Trillion by 2024: MKM.)

For Mapsignals, the strongest indicator of positive price momentum is obtained by measuring potential institutional accumulation. In 2018, Amazon stock has logged 23 of these rare signals. We like to see bullish activity in the shares alongside solid forward fundamentals, as this indicates that demand for the stock should increase over time.

In the chart below, Amazon stock broke out to new 52-week highs on big volumes. Shares should continue the upward trajectory:

Mapsignals' goal is to identify tomorrow's top stocks today. We're basically looking for outlier companies with healthy fundamentals accompanied by outsized, unusual institutional trading activity. By studying these data points, we can hypothesize which equities institutions are trafficking in and marry this information with fundamentally sound companies. We want the odds on our side when looking for the highest-quality stocks.

When deciding on the strongest candidate for long-term growth, we consider many technical areas important to success. A few of these for Amazon are as follows:

Year-to-date (YTD) outperformance vs. market: +53.77% vs. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

YTD outperformance vs. sector: +45.8% vs. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK)

Bullish potential accumulation signals

Below you can see points in 2018 where Amazon made buy signals for Mapsignals:

**Data provided by MAP, IEX, FactSet and Tiingo

On top of a great technical picture, one should also look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Amazon has solid sales and earnings growth rates:

One-year sales growth rate: +39%

One-year operating income increased to $3 billion from $628 million in 2017

Third quarter net sales guidance expected growth: +23% to 31%

Amazon checks the box on strong technicals and fundamentals while showing bullish institutional momentum in 2018. We believe that the current level for the shares is in position for further upside. All of this points to further long-term bullish action for the stock. (See also: Is Amazon Getting Serious About Blockchain?)

The Bottom Line

Amazon stock represents a potential buying opportunity for the long-term investor. Given the solid earnings growth, revenue growth and multiple unusual accumulation signals, this stock could be worth a spot in a growth-oriented portfolio.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazon-stock-could-burst-through-2000-for-a-20-rally-cm1014462,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Through the first eight months of the year, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) may very well be the most impressive FANG stock, with Amazon stock up more than 63% so far this year.

We might not have thought that a few months ago when Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) was up 120% on the year . If anything, though, Amazon was a close second, particularly given the flat performance from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and the solid, but not triple-digit return of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ).

What makes Amazon stock so darn impressive is its size. Netflix may still be up 87% on the year, but its $155-billion market cap is a far cry from Amazon's $930-billion valuation.

Heck, there was even a point where investors thought that despite starting the year with a market cap of $550 billion to Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) almost $900-billion market cap, Amazon could hit $1 trillion before the iPhone maker.

That didn't pan out, but the fact that it was even a discussion is impressive.

Sizing Up Amazon Stock

Hopping onto a $930-billion company that's up more than 60% so far this year feels like a big overpay. I don't think many investors would argue that, particularly when Amazon doesn't make that much money - at least compared to the other behemoths, like Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).

That fact really irks the bears, who have been pounding the table on valuation for a decade. That hasn't slowed down CEO Jeff Bezos & Co. yet, so why should it now?

I hate jumping into a stock like this too late, so a pullback would be ideal. But as we enter the second half of the year amid a strong economic environment, it's hard not to like Amazon. That's evident by the earnings results we just saw from Target (NYSE: TGT ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) and a number of others. If they're doing well, you know Amazon is too.

But Amazon has so many other growth avenues. There's the obvious retail arm and the multi-billion cash cow that Prime has grown into. Don't forget about the forgiving and patient investor base.

Finally, there's the underappreciated advertising leg and the not-so-undervalued Amazon Web Services unit. We've seen strong cloud results from seemingly every player in the industry. I continue to argue that the cloud is in a period of resurgence, benefiting everyone from service providers to data-center REITs.

Given its leadership position in the cloud, I would expect growth to be strong for quite some time for Amazon.

Amazon Growth

How strong? Analysts expect earnings of more than $17 per share this year, up almost four-fold from last year's earnings of $4.56 per share. Next year, they expect growth of 45%. On the sales front - something that's always been more of a focus than profits - analysts expect impressive results. Amazon is forecast to grow sales 32% this year and 22% next year.

The above-20% revenue growth rate has been a key metric for Amazon stock investors.

Last quarter was strong, even though AMZN missed revenue estimates by more than $400 million. Investors were willing to overlook it, though.

Maybe it was the strength in its core businesses or the fact that earnings of $5.07 per share doubled expectations. It could be that sales still grew ~40% year-over-year or that in the prior quarter, revenue came in more than $1 billion ahead of estimates.

The end result? Growth is incredibly robust. Until it slows, Amazon stock will continue to grind higher.

Trading Amazon Stock



Click to Enlarge

The average analyst price target over the last 90 days is $2,122, implying more than 11% upside. The high target sits at $2,300, implying almost 21% upside from current levels.

Can it get there?

Amazon stock has pushed through short-term resistance near $1,925. So long as its strong-and-steady uptrend stays in place, it's really hard to get bearish.

A test of channel resistance (purple line) should get Amazon over $2,000, while two strong uptrend levels should act as support. Coincidentally, those levels both come into play near the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.

I would be a buyer at both levels, and anything else is just noise. Keep it simple when it comes to Amazon stock.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-the-rally-in-walmart-stock-is-fading-cm1014452,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) has ridden quite the roller coaster of late. WMT stock rose just shy of $110 in late January, buoyed by a strong market and hopes that it was becoming a worthy competitor to Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). By May, the stock had dropped about 25%.

Disappointing Q4 earnings in February were a key driver. The Q1 report didn't help much , either. It certainly didn't seem like Amazon was at risk. Indeed, as Dana Blankenhorn argued, Walmart seemed to be losing to both Amazon and Costco (NASDAQ: COST ).

Walmart then went and posted a blowout Q2. Suddenly, the company's omnichannel strategy seemed to be working - again. U.S. comps were the company's best in over a decade. WMT stock soared, touching $100.

Since then, investors have sold the news. WMT stock has dropped six out of the last seven sessions, falling over 5% from post-earnings highs.

That reaction seems somewhat incongruous in the context of the strong Q2 report and the potentially rehabilitated bull case for Walmart stock. But looking closer, the post-earnings weakness makes some sense. Walmart already is pricing in a decent amount of success, and it still has a lot of work left to do.

The Good News From Walmart Earnings

Again, it looks like Walmart is on the right track coming out of the Q2 report. EPS of $1.29 beat consensus by $0.07. Revenue growth was a point better than the Street projected. U.S. same-store sales rose 4.5%, which as noted was the best performance since before the financial crisis. Notably, Walmart gained 2 points on both traffic and ticket, showing broader strength.

Sam's Club strengthened, posting a 5% comp. International sales rose 4%, and more than 3% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EPS guidance was raised to $4.90-$5.05, up from $4.75-$5.00.

Meanwhile, the omnichannel efforts once again appear to be working. It was weaker-than-expected e-commerce performance in Q4 - growth of ""just"" 23% - that spooked investors in February. In Q2, however, e-commerce sales rose 40%. And the company continued adding to its capabilities, adding automated pickup towers and expanding grocery pickup options.

If the WMT stock story is based on the company adapting to - and thriving in - the omnichannel era, Q2 seems to be good news. So why is WMT stock selling off?

The Concerns

There are two concerns I see coming out of the quarter. The first is that profits continue to head in the wrong direction despite the headline beat.

Operating income has declined the last three years and fell another 3%+ year-over-year in Q2. Wage increases are hitting operating expenses. Competition, from not only Amazon but Target (NYSE: TGT ), Kroger (NYSE: KR ) and many others, and Walmart's longstanding dedication to lower prices are affecting gross margins.

There are some short-term impacts from those omnichannel investments, of course. Still, some of the pressures are more permanent (notably on the labor front). And pricing and margin pressure continues across the space, in both grocery and retail.

That leads to the second concern: valuation. WMT stock hardly looks expensive. After the modest pullback over the past few sessions, it trades at 19x the midpoint of FY19 EPS guidance. Against the market as a whole, that hardly seems like a steep price to pay.

But, again, Walmart's space remains relatively challenged. TGT trades at 16x. KR is under 15x. COST and, of course, AMZN, trade at much more elevated valuations. But those companies aren't posting sub-4% YOY revenue growth or declining operating income.

Walmart already is pricing in a return to profit growth - and consistent, steady profit growth. Q2 seems to show that growth is coming, but after two less-successful quarters, that change in trend hardly seems assured.

On the Sidelines With WMT Stock

From here, then, the pullback to the mid-90s makes some sense. For one, we've been here before with WMT stock - just seven months ago when it looked like Walmart was set to combat Amazon's market share gains. Yes, a 4.5% comp is impressive. But Amazon grew revenue 37% in its fiscal second quarter, off a much larger base than Walmart's e-commerce sales.

Secondly, 19x earnings is expensive in an industry where margins are thin and getting thinner.

That's not to say WMT stock is a sell or a short. In fact, all else equal, I'd probably lean toward buying WMT at these levels (and indeed I've been bullish in the past ). But I'd like a cheaper price or more confidence in the omnichannel efforts. Given the quarter and recent price action, in the next couple of months, it's possible both may be on the way.

As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

This investment strategy comes with its fair share of risks, but it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns-an end goal that every investor desires.

Over the past several years, Wall Street's most exciting growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector. From industry innovators like Amazon AMZN and Netflix NFLX to exciting foreign stocks such as Alibaba BABA , tech-focused growth investors have been rewarded with massive profits recently.

Strong earnings and impressive sales imply that the technology sector's hot streak could continue throughout 2018-despite recent market-wide volatility. That means that growth investors searching for the next great market-beating stock might want to keep their focus on tech companies.

Luckily, we can pair the proven Zacks Rank with our innovative Style Scores system, which includes a ""Growth"" category, to find strong growth tech stocks. Investors should note that our Growth category values earnings and sales growth, as well as improvements to a company's financial statements-including strong cash flows and great return on equity.

With all of this said, check out these three tech stocks for growth investors to consider now:

1. AppFolio, Inc. ( APPF )

AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries. The company's AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management, while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms. Currently, the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

AppFolio recently surged into profitability, which is something that investors tend to reward. This fiscal year, current estimates are calling for earnings growth of 93% and net sales growth of 28%. The company is also improving its cash position, generating quadruple-digit cash flow growth and operating with a net margin of nearly 11%.

The firm has also proven to be an efficient one, with Return on Equity of 20% crushing its industry average. AppFolio should be able to use this, and its solid margins, to capitalize on its new business opportunities. APPF has also displayed the strength of small caps recently, adding about 100% over the past six months.

2. Cypress Semiconductor ( CY )

Cypress Semiconductor makes chips designed for the automotive, industrial, home automation and appliances, consumer electronics and medical products industries. It has emerged as a leader in the Internet of Things industry after shelling out $550 million for Broadcom's IoT business in 2016. Cypress' ""WICED"" IoT platform is part of one of the largest such portfolios in the industry.

While semiconductor stocks have been volatile at times this year, we believe there is still plenty of growth opportunity in secular trends like IoT. This should give Cypress a unique opportunity to keep expanding, even as cyclical industry concerns persist.

According to our latest consensus estimates, analysts expect to finish the current fiscal year with EPS growth of nearly 51% over the prior year. Cypress also has a long-term projected annual EPS growth rate in excess of 16% right now. Meanwhile, CY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3. NetApp, Inc. ( NTAP )

NetApp specializes in hybrid cloud solutions; in other words, it provides data-based services which simplify the management of applications cloud and on-premises environments. NetApp's products and solutions are in high demand as enterprises around the world continue modernizing and adapting to cloud technology. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports promising growth characteristics.

Notably, NetApp has an ""A"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Earnings are projected to improve by more than 27% in 2018, and that growth is expected to continue to the tune of 14% on a long-term, annualized basis. NetApp is also notching cash flow growth of about 25% right now.

Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies

It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Shares of Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD) were moving higher today after the battered retailer said it would expand its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to install tires sold on Amazon at Sears Auto Centers nationally.

As a result, the stock was up 12.8% as of 3:04 p.m. EDT.

Image source: Sears.

So what

The partnership builds on a test between the two companies launched in May, in which 47 Sears Auto Center locations in eight metro areas performed installations and balancing for any brand of tires, including Sears-owned DieHard.

Now, Sears and Amazon are expanding the so-called Ship-to-Store tire solution program nationwide. The option to have your tires shipped directly to Sears and installed is integrated into the Amazon checkout process.

Sears Automotive Vice President Mike McCarthy said, ""The response from Amazon customers around this program has been extremely positive, adding that the service is ""resonating with customers.""

Now what

While the partnership with Amazon may be a win for Sears Auto Centers, it does little to change the trajectory of the overall business. Sears stock has plunged to nearly $1 amid ongoing concerns about its liquidity as the company bleeds cash and sales continue to tumble. Just last week Sears said it would close 46 more stores.

Investors may be hopeful that the partnership with Amazon could lead to a further helping hand, or even an acquisition, from the e-commerce giant, but that seems unlikely. There's not much of a good argument for Amazon's taking over Sears, and when Amazon does make acquisitions, it buys well-run, forward-looking, successful business like Whole Foods, Ring, and PillPack. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is not looking for fixer-uppers.

I'd expect Sears shares to resume their downward slide shortly, especially with the company's second-quarter earnings report on deck.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/alphabet-roundup-hardware-privacy-app-store-tax-health-china-cm1014369,"Of the ton of Alphabet GOOGL news in the last few weeks, the following appear to be the most significant-

Hardware News

Alphabet has toyed with the idea of making hardware for quite a while now although it hasn't really made a play for market share or made a big deal about share it picked up. But the fact remains that the company acquired Motorola Mobility only to swallow most of its patents and discard the rest of the company. Then earlier this year, it picked up HTC's mobile business, again spurring rumors that it may be venturing into hardware, but we don't really know.

What we do know, however, is that its flagship Pixel line of hardware, including the Pixelbook (high-end Chromebook), Pixel smartphones and Pixel Watch, as well as Google Home smart home speakers are picking up mindshare.

Google doesn't yet need a hardware line of its own (licensing its technology to other hardware makers is a far more profitable proposition and regulatory pressure hasn't materially harmed it). But it continues to pick up all the pieces it needs to create leading edge devices and continues to improve upon device quality. Hardware makers can use the devices as prototypes.

But the market is changing quickly with the advent of IoT devices where connectivity is more closely tied to the hardware itself, with the services the devices enable being the biggest selling point. In such an environment, involving more players in the device making itself can increase chances of regulatory scrutiny while making it more difficult to generate profits.

The Google Home device for example, allows the user to shop, listen to music, catch up on news, make calls, connect with other devices to facilitate household operations and so forth. Google or market leader Amazon AMZN gets to collect user data about habits, preferences, etc. to advertise and sell more effectively. So now, capturing the hardware share that can sell the services is more important. Which is why the smart speaker numbers from Strategy Analytics are so significant.

Amazon's market share dropped from 76% in 2Q17 to 41% in 2Q18 despite growing units from 2.9 million to 4.8 million as the market grew 200% from 3.9 million units to 11.7 million units. Alphabet was the biggest gainer, growing from 16% to 28% (3.2 million units) followed by Alibaba BABA and Apple AAPL , which went from 0 to a respective 7% and 6%. Even JD.com JD took a 2% share.

Standalone Retail Store

The Chicago Tribune reports that Google is planning a two-level store in Chicago's Fulton Market district, close to its Midwest headquarters. While company spokespersons maintain that they don't comment on rumors and speculation, it's an interesting development that seems to point at its hardware ambitions.

Privacy Pains

San Diego resident Napoleon Patacsil has sued Google for collecting user location data even when they have location history turned off and is seeking unspecified damages. In his words, Google's ""principal goal was to surreptitiously monitor [the claimant] and to allow third-parties to do the same.""

The legal challenge was issued under California's Consumer Privacy Act, which was framed in line with the stringent GDPR that Europe adopted in May this year and is seeking class action status. If granted, millions of Android and iPhone users may join the case.

The complaints have been ongoing for quite some time now although this suit is the most formal approach. Even last week, privacy-focused Big Brother Watch accused Google of harvesting data ""secretly, against people's will.""

Google's wrongdoing appears clear from its actions-

Earlier its support policy read: ""With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.""

A Google spokesperson also clarified earlier: ""There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people's experience, including: Location, History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services…We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.""

But on Friday, the support policy was changed to: ""This setting does not affect other location services on your device... some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other services, like Search and Maps."" Moreover, the company now says that ""We have been updating the explanatory language about Location History to make it more consistent and clear across our platforms and help centers.""

On that very day, privacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center complained to the FTC that the company's recording of time-stamped location data even after users have turned off Location History was in clear violation of its 2011 settlement.

ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani also told Bloomberg that this kind of data collection is a concern, particularly if there's deception involved, she strongly advocated a GDPR-like legislation for the U.S. and also said that Congress was debating the issue.

Separately, Professor Douglas Schmidt of Vanderbilt University (Nashville, Tennessee) found in a study that people browsing with Chrome in Incognito mode could have their activity linked retrospectively to account information in Google-owned services like Gmail and YouTube. Also, ""While such data is collected with user-anonymous identifiers, Google has the ability to connect this collected information with a user's personal credentials stored in their Google Account.""

Incognito mode is worded carefully. It reads: ""Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won't see your activity.""

Google's response: ""This report is commissioned by a professional DC lobbyist group, and written by a witness for Oracle ORCL in their ongoing copyright litigation with Google... So, it's no surprise that it contains wildly misleading information.""

App Store Tax

Google and Apple have for long helped developers reach their audiences on devices running Android or iOS. They've done this by weeding out clones, malware, malicious attacks, thus reducing security risk while also helping with payments, to make the whole process secure and smooth for users. But the 30% cut they take from every purchase (including in-app purchases) has created tension with some developers, especially the bigger ones, who have at times negotiated sweeter deals.

But now, some have decided they no longer need to pay the ""app store tax."" Recently, Netflix NFLX , which has been the most popular app on iOS with most money spent and the greatest number of downloads on Android, according to App Annie, decided it didn't need the stores any longer. The company is now making the service available directly at its own website.

The hit to Apple and Google revenues isn't known and probably won't be significant with respect to their total revenues, but it will be a blow to app store revenue that has been climbing steadily for both. This is the second defection in a short time for Google, which earlier lost $50 million a year when Fortnite Battle Royale was moved by its creator Epic Games. It's a disturbing trend but not one that most developers can afford given that the app stores offer access to billions of users.

Health

Psychologists have started pointing to the impact of constant exposure to mostly negative news, which could be mild to major depression in people. Others that haven't developed the condition yet could question whether it's really all so bad out there. To help solve the problem, or at least to take a break from it all, Google is testing a new feature for all Assistant-enabled devices.

So when you say, ""OK Google, tell me something good,"" Assistant will surface some heartening, feel-good things happening around the world that reinstates your faith in humanity. The news is selected with help from nonprofit Solutions Journalism Network that links you to stories from a range of credible media like The New York Times , BBC and NPR. But let's face it, negative news and sensationalism sell better, so some of the stories surfaced could be a few years old.

Alphabet-backed One Medical, which is a primary care group accepting both insurance and out-of-pocket payments, is raising $200 million from private equity firm Carlyle Group, which will also buy $100 million worth of shares from existing investors. Meanwhile, Alphabet plans to invest $375 million in health insurance startup Oscar Health, giving it a 10% share. The money is expected to help its expansion into more markets and business segments, including Medicare Advantage for seniors in 2020.

Another heath initiative from Alphabet and its partners, London's Moorfields Eye Hospital and the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, is the use of artificial intelligence from DeepMind to help doctors to detect 50+ sight-threatening conditions from a simple eye scan. Clinical trials are expected to start next year for the system that has performed better than humans in internal trials.

If it gains regulatory approval, the first products will be rolled out by Moorfields Eye Hospital across the UK. The NHS has said that Moorfields owns the data used to develop the software, and can use it freely in other research.

Project Wooden, which is developing Google's soon-to-go-live unimaginatively named fitness coach called ""Google Coach"" may help Google catch up with similar services from Apple and Fitbit FIT , the leaders in the smart watch category. Google Coach will draw on location, calendar and other user information to suggest AI-based actionable health recommendations, including suitable workout routines and dietary adjustments to improve nutrition.

The rumor comes from Android Police although Google's limited presence in the category almost makes this development inconsequential. On the other hand, its expansion to other devices like smartphones, where Android has a bigger presence, may not be as useful since nobody ties a smartphone to their wrist or wears it to bed, etc.

China Plans Exploratory

Google responded to the employee protest of its possible return to China, particularly its censored search engine internally called Dragonfly that was reported in The Intercept in early August.

CEO Pichai told employees that the attempt was exploratory, that discussions were in the early stages and that they didn't include controversial topics. He said that Google remains ""very open about our desire to do more in China,"" and that the team ""has been in an exploration stage for quite a while now,"" ""exploring many options.""

Despite the protests, this isn't something that a technology company has done for the first time; the popular Mozilla search engine has continued to operate on China's own terms for quite a while. But given Baidu's dominance, its nationalistic brand positioning and government support, foreign search engines have had the going rough.

Google, if it launches in China, will likely have other focus areas, where it can more easily find partners like Tencent (on whose platforms it can sell apps) and JD, which it can support with retail technology and strategy as it takes on market leader Alibaba. Then there's Waymo, which furthers the Chinese goal of getting more electric cars on the road.

In this context, the purpose of incorporation of Google's Chinese subsidiary called Huimo Business Consulting (Shanghai) Co. on May 22 in Shanghai's free trade zone makes perfect sense: business and logistics consultancy, as well as services related to the design and testing of self-driving car parts.

Protestors probably need to take a more pragmatic approach to China, especially given that it isn't alone in limiting searchable information; Germany and other parts of Europe are doing likewise. Moreover, Google's goal in China doesn't appear to be the simple operation of a search engine, but rather its synergistic application to support other business opportunities.

Technology stocks firmed during Tuesday trading, with the shares of tech stocks in the S&P 500 were adding about 0.1% in value this afternoon while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was posting a nearly 0.3% gain.

Among technology stocks moving on news:

+ Brooks Automation ( BRKS ) rallied Tuesday, racing over 31% higher to its best share price since April 2002 at $34.02 a share after the company late Monday said it was selling its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC for $675 million in cash. Brooks acquired the business during its 2005 merger with Helix Technology, with the current transaction also including the company's CTI pump and its Polycold chiller businesses as well as its 50% stake in its Ulvac Cryogenics joint venture in Japan. The deal excludes any products or intellectual property developed through Brooks' Life Sciences unit or the vacuum automation portfolio in its Semiconductor Solutions subsidiary.

In other sector news:

+ Bilibili ( BILI ) jumped as much as 19% on Tuesday after the Chinese internet content provider narrowed its Q2 net loss compared with year-ago levels, reporting a non-GAAP net loss of RMB0.07, or about $0.01, per share and easily eclipsing the Capital IQ consensus expecting a normalized loss of RMB 0.13 per share. Sales rose 76% year over year to RMB1.027 billlion, or about $155.1 million, also topping the RMB1 billion analyst mean.

+ Fitbit ( FIT ) was almost 1% higher after the smart-watch manufacturer reportedly said it has assembled the largest set of heart-rate data ever collected with more than 150 billion hours of data from around the world. While acknowledging the data could be biased because it all comes from people who are affluent enough to own Fitbit devices, the company said the data also appears to confirm a high resting heart rate correlates with earlier death.

+ Amazon.com ( AMZN ) was edging higher Tuesday following reports its Amazon Pay unit is in talks to acquire Tapzo, an Indian app aggregator.

It's been a red-hot summer for Walmart (NYSE: WMT ). Yes, in its latest quarterly report, the company showed that it can still post solid numbers. Walmart stock jumped 9% in response and Jim Cramer introduced the WANG stocks (albeit to mixed response ).

WMT revenues hit $138.03 billion, compared to the Street consensus of $125.97 billion. The bottom line was also impressive, with earnings per share coming to $1.29. The analysts' consensus, on the other hand, was looking for $1.22.

Comparable sales growth was also standout. In the quarter, the US growth rate was 4.5% (this was the best in a decade). In fact, it was 5% for Sam's Club locations.

But despite all this good news, there's still a sticking point - that is, Walmart stock is far from cheap. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 19x. By comparison, Target (NYSE: TGT ) is at 15x and Kroger (NYSE: KR ) trades at 14x.

So then what now for investors? Is there more opportunity here for the bull case? Well, I think so. Here's a look at three key drivers for Walmart stock:

Why Walmart Stock Has More Upside: Strong Tailwinds

The dreaded ""retail apocalypse"" may be a good development for Walmart stock. How so? Well, the bankruptcies and store closures have reduced the capacity in the market. In other words, it means less competitive pressure for large players like Walmart.

But there is another important factor to keep in mind as well: the strength of the US economy. In the second quarter, GDP growth was 4.1% and the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%. There has also been a pick-up in incomes, bolstered by the tax cuts. The result is that consumers are more confident, which has led to higher spending.

According to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon, on the earnings call:

""Customers tell us that they feel better about the current health of the U.S. economy as well as their personal finances. They're more confident about their employment opportunities.""

Why Walmart Stock Has More Upside: Innovation

Walmart was late to e-commerce, which has definitely been a major problem for the company's growth. But over the past few years, it has been making up for lost time. Part of this has been from internal investments. But WMT has also turned up the volume on M&A. Some of its deals include the purchases of Jet.com, Shoebuy, Modcloth and Parcel.

As for Walmart.com, there has been a redesign.There is now a 3D-virtual tour for the Home category, and WMT has added 1,100 new brands to the site, such as Shimano, Therm-a-Rest, Lord & Taylor and Steve Madden.

In terms of the growth, the e-commerce business is on the right track. For the full-year, Walmart expects a growth rate of 40%.

The company has also been smart to leverage its brick-and-mortar assets. For example, Walmart has been opening pick-up stations (there are over 1,800 just for for groceries ). As Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) has demonstrated, a bricks-and-clicks strategy can be an effective way to fend of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

Why Walmart Stock Has More Upside: India

Back in May, when Walmart announced the acquisition of 77% of India's largest e-commerce player, Flipkart, there was quite a bit of skepticism on Wall Street. After all, the valuation was steep. There was also the hit-or-miss history of Walmart's foreign deal-making.

But despite all this, the Flipkart deal could be a big winner. For the first six months of this year, the sales are estimated to have spiked by 50% , whereas Amazon.com's India business has increased between 35-40% in the same time frame.

And Flipkart has also been getting traction with its mobile payments business, which is ranked number 2 in the country. There are 100 million users on the platform and 300,000 merchants.

When it comes to India, the growth opportunities are enormous. According to eMarketer , ecommerce spending is projected to jump by 31% to $32.7 billion this year and reach $71.94 billion by 2022 - which is the kind of scale that can even move the needle for a company like Walmart.

Amid the trade tensions between the United States and China, investors continued to pour money into fast-growing companies, pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to new highs for the second consecutive day. The benchmark crossed the 8,000 milestone for the first time and is now up 16.1% this year so far.

Most of the surge was powered by big gains in large-capitalization technology and Internet stocks and is the latest sign that the longest bull market in Wall Street history remains healthy.

The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.

Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.

Further, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks also provide nice boost to Nasdaq. A defensive tilt in the uncertain times raised the appeal of healthcare stocks while booming economy coupled with higher consumer spending drove discretionary stocks higher.

As a result, Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ ), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed 18.8% so far this year. Let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.

In a bid to bolster presence in the grocery retail space, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has rolled out its second cashierless store, Amazon Go, in Seattle. Notably, the first Amazon Go was also established in Seattle in the beginning of this year.

The new store will stock ready-to-eat food items like salads, sandwiches and wraps as well as Amazon meal kits. Further, there will be racks of quick eatables like candies, chocolates, chips and other snack items.

Per a report from Statista, revenues in the U.S. food and beverages market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2018 and 2022 and to reach $25.98 billion by 2022. Further, revenues in this particular market are projected at $16.2 billion for 2018.

We note that the latest move of the company will strengthen its footprint in this rapidly growing market.

Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 64.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry 's rally of 33.4%.

Strengthening Physical Presence

Amazon's efforts to bolster physical presence in the retail space are providing it with a competitive edge against the local stores. Notably, these local Amazon stores are already reeling under competitive pressure related to price and delivery owing to AMZN's online presence.

With the second brick-and-mortar grocery store, Amazon aims at making an average office goers' life easier in today's fast-paced world by allowing them to just grab whatever food item they want.

The company wants to provide hassle-free food items which are ready-to-eat and can be purchased without standing in a queue due to its cashierless facility. This will consequently save a lot of time.

Reportedly, the company is planning to set up more Amazon Go stores in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.

The company started bolstering its presence in the grocery market following the Whole Foods acquisition.

We believe the company is well-poised to rapidly penetrate the U.S. grocery retail market with the aid of the above-mentioned endeavors.

Further, Amazon recently clinched a partnership deal with Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) for its Fire TV. This will provide a brick-and-mortar showroom to Amazon, and will aid in providing a better hands-on experience to customers for its latest smart TV.

Moreover, the company strengthened its physical presence by opening its third bookstore in the Bay Area few months ago. The company has around 15 offline stores, while three have a work-in-progress status.

Strengthening Competitive Position

The e-commerce giant's aggressive retail strategies will help it in reaping benefits from the rapidly growing retail market.

According to the latest report from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.3% between 2018 and 2023 and to reach $31.9 trillion by 2023.

Expanding physical presence, robust fast delivery services and improving product offerings will continue to strengthen its competitive position against the retail giants such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ).

Moreover, this will continue to strengthen its market share in the highly growing retail market.

Currently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Shares of Google parent Alphabet GOOGL opened lower on Tuesday after the search giant found itself the target of late-night tweets from President Donald Trump. In two posts sent in the wee hours of the morning, Trump claimed that Google rigs its results in favor of ""left-wing media,"" cloaking positive news about him and his administration in the process.

The president cited some dubious numbers in his tweets, but as investors know from Trump's clashes with Amazon AMZN and Jeff Bezos, the reasoning might not matter so much as the results. If Google has drawn the permanent ire of Trump, it could be in store for more public criticism soon.

Elsewhere, investors and coffee drinkers today celebrated the Pumpkin Spice Latte, a popular seasonal beverage from Starbucks SBUX . In its 15 th year, the PSL is a Starbucks staple and a trendy favorite among younger caffeine enthusiasts. This year, it is debuting in the month of August for the very first time.

The news that is sending Sears stock higher today is that the tire installation and balance offer available for Amazon customers is available at more stores. In fact, it is now available at all Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) Auto Centers in the U.S. This also includes both Alaska and Hawaii.

This is a major increase in the number of stores that are part of the deal. Previously, the offer was only available to Amazon customers that took their cars to 47 select Sears Auto Center locations in eight metropolitan markets.

The deal between Sears and Amazon has the former installing all tires and balancing them for customers that purchase them through Amazon. This includes Sears' own DieHard brand, as well as any other tire. AMZN customers can choose to have their tires installed at Sears when going through the checkout process.

""The response from Amazon customers around this program has been extremely positive,"" Mike McCarthy, Vice President and General Manager of Sears Automotive, said in a statement . ""Our competitive bundled price for tire installation, which includes the installation of the tire, wheel balancing, valve stem or tire pressure monitor rebuild kit and the tire disposal fee is resonating with these customers.""

The expanding deal with Amazon is great news for Sears stock in light of the company's recent issues. Problems at the retailer have resulted in it closing hundreds of stores across the U.S. The most recent closing announcement from the company adds another 33 stores to that list. This also includes locations with Sears Auto Centers.

Wall Street is setting records even in the S&P 500 , and the retail sector has recently fallen back into favor. We've seen new highs in stocks that we thought were dead not too long ago. However this morning Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) stock has fallen 5% on its earnings headline.

Management actually beat expectations on sales and profitability. But as is often these days, they disappointed with the forward guidance. So investors are showing their disappointment.

Moreover, the growth rate of Best Buy's online sales declined for the second quarter in a row. This is another hot button area for retail stocks. Investors are obsessed with growing online sales. But I think in BBY's case this is misguided.

The company is carving a niche to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Best Buy is the place where shoppers can actually touch the tech before they buy it, and perhaps get help choosing what they actually need. This is something Amazon cannot do yet.

So to me a miss on online traffic is not a concern at this point for Best Buy stock. In fact, in other retail stocks like Macy's (NYSE: M ), for example, a growth in online sales is merely their own foot-traffic sales moving online. They are not taking back sales from AMZN.

If the markets don't correct then BBY stock will shrug this dip off, so this is a knife I can cautiously catch. Since stocks in general are at all-time highs, my conviction in higher prices for the stock is low. However I have strong faith in the fact that proven support will hold through 2018. And therein lies the opportunity.

In today's setup, I use options to sell downside risk against what other people fear. This is an opportunity to generate income without any out-of-pocket expense. But if BBY falls below my level of risk than I own the shares at a 20% discount from this morning's already-lower price. I am confident that in the long term I can manage out of the risk for a profit.

Fundamentally, BBY stock is not expensive with a 19 price to earnings ratio. Technically, it came into the earnings event up almost 20% in the past three months. This is equal to Amazon's performance for the same period. So a dip on the headline event is normal price action and doesn't change the actual fundamentals that are currently in the stock.

Most Wall Street analysts have the stock as a HOLD so there is little chance of them downgrading it further. Although we could see a few price target changes but nothing is imminent so the headline risk is favorable to bulls for the mid term.

BBY Stock Trade

The Trade: Sell BBY DEC $60 naked put and collect $1 to open. Here I have a 85% theoretical chance that I would retain maximum gains. But if price falls below my strike then I accrue losses below $59.

Those who want to mitigate the risk that comes with selling naked puts can sell spreads instead.

The Alternate Trade: Sell BBY DEC $62.50/$60 bull put spread where I have the same odds of winning. Then the spread would yield 15% on risk.

Today's trade, although it would benefit from one, doesn't need a rally to profit. I merely need BBY stock to hold its support for the next few months.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/alphabet-stock-opens-lower-as-trump-claims-google-suppresses-news-cm1014203,"Shares of Alphabet GOOGL dipped in early morning trading Tuesday after President Donald Trump accused Google of rigging its search results to favor liberal media and suppressing positive news about him.

The president took to his preferred platform, Twitter, in the wee hours of Tuesday morning to share his thoughts, claiming that Google search results for ""Trump News"" yield only results from the ""Fake New [sic] Media.""

Trump also tweeted that 96% of search results for the above term are from the ""National Left-Wing Media,"" a statistic which many critics have already called dubious. As The Verge reports , the claim appears to have originated from conservative outlet PJ Media and later spread to other right-wing voices.

The 96% statistic is the analysis of a lone reporter who Googled the term ""Trump"" a number of times using different computers, then tallied up the perceived bias of the outlets in the first 100 results, according to The Verge .

Trump's public lashing out at Google was enough to cause some mild headline volatility for the stock this morning.

This is not, of course, the first time the president's tweets have had an effect on the share prices of a major technology company.

Notably, President Trump has sparred with Amazon AMZN and its enigmatic CEO, Jeff Bezos. In several instances-dating back as far as his campaign and occurring as recently as this summer-Trump used Twitter to voice concerns that Bezos and Amazon are avoiding taxes and manipulating the U.S. Post Office in their favor.

But at the root of Trump's frustration with both Amazon and Google is one commonality: criticism of his administration.

Indeed, many of Trump's verbal and virtual jousts with Amazon followed critical reporting of the White House in the Washington Post , a popular newspaper and online publication owned by none other than Bezos.

Similarly, in today's tweets about Google, Trump is frustrated by what he perceives as bias against him. Whether or not Google is actually rigging results is another question entirely, but it is clear that a trend is developing in Trump's wars of words with tech firms.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shares have a long and consistent history of rewarding breakout buyers. It's a trait that all of the best trending stocks carry. Once resistance defenders are finally felled, bulls are quick to scale the ramparts and power forward. We're witnessing such a phenomenon play out today. Amazon stock just cleared resistance and is tagging a new record as I type.

AMZN stock kicked off 2018 with a bang and it hasn't looked back since. Year-to-date, the online retail king has added 66% to what was already a hefty market cap. Shareholders are basking in Benjamins with full faith and confidence in Jeff Bezos' ability to continue delivering.

From a technical perspective, Amazon stock has been incredibly well behaved. Let's begin with the weekly time frame.

Source: OptionsAnalytix

The tagline for Amazon shares should be ""gravity defiance."" Overbought readings have accompanied its rocketship rise for months on end. Indeed, it's the poster child for a trend in motion remaining in motion. The ascending channel that began last October has operated like clockwork with nary a misstep. With the psychologically significant $2,000 level looming overhead, I think AMZN stock will continue melting higher to test it in the coming days.

We can see the history of breakouts by turning to the daily chart. Resistance zones have proven powerless in stopping Amazon's rise. The moving averages are confirming the trend's dominance with the 20-day and 50-day rising closely below like loyal puppies.

Source: OptionsAnalytix

Monday's pop in AMZN stock and today's follow through confirm that resistance has once again given way. And that makes now as good a time as any for deploying bullish trades.

Amazon Stock Option Play

To control the cost of our trade, we can build a bull call spread. Buy the Oct $1,950 call and sell the Oct $1,970 call. The $20-wide vertical spread currently trades for $9.40. This sets you up to more than double your money if Amazon stock can rise above $1,970 in the next two months. The risk is $940, and the reward is $1,060.

Whetstone, who replaced Jonathan Friedland, is currently a Facebook FB executive and is expected to join the streaming giant from November this year.





Whetstone's previous engagements with Alphabet's GOOGL Google and Uber indicate the kind of experience she will bring to the table for Netflix, particularly at a time when the streaming giant is increasing its efforts to expand user base by investing heavily on original content.We believe Whetstone's exposure to both domestic and international markets is expected to boost Netflix's presence, especially in the international markets.Netflix's strengthening international content portfolio has been the key growth driver in recent times.

Netflix is increasingly investing in original content in regional programming to cash in on the huge user base.Moreover, Netflix's back-to-back commissioning of original content in South Korea is helping the company solidify its footprint.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazons-whole-foods-strategy-is-working-cm1014125,"It's been a year since Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) acquired Whole Foods Market, and competing grocers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Kroger (NYSE: KR) haven't seen too much impact. But smaller grocery and retail chains including Trader Joe's have been losing foot traffic to nearby Whole Foods stores over the past year, according to data from Sense360 reported by Bloomberg .

Whole Foods is managing to steal traffic from nearby stores in more-urban areas. Walmart and Kroger stores are generally more suburban and have seen a very muted impact, if any. But if Amazon builds more suburban stores or expands its free delivery service, it could be bad news for the larger grocers.

Image source: Amazon.

What's changed at Whole Foods?

Amazon hasn't changed much at Whole Foods stores. It's started selling its own electronic devices like Echo speakers alongside organic produce, and installed lockers for customers to pick up Amazon.com orders. For the most part, however, Whole Foods stores look like they did a year ago.

But Amazon has moved quickly to integrate its Prime membership program into the grocery store known for its high prices. Prime members get discounts on everyday items throughout the store, including a 25% discount in its bulk section, where you can buy dried fruit and nuts by the pound. Members with the Amazon credit card get an additional 5% cashback savings when using the card at checkout.

That's been enough to attract some extra foot traffic to the stores. The percentage of shoppers who visited a Whole Foods at least six times in the past year increased to 11% in August from 9% a year ago, according to Tabs Analytics.

Amazon has also been testing free delivery for Prime members in select markets and free curbside pickup for online orders in other markets. It plans to eventually expand both services nationwide.

Maybe Walmart and Kroger have felt some impact

As mentioned, Walmart and Kroger haven't seen much change in their foot traffic. In fact, sales at both chains have been great in 2018. Walmart posted spectacular second-quarter results with same-store sales increasing 4.5% in the U.S. Management specifically called out strong fresh-food sales growth in its earnings presentation. Kroger's sales increased 2.8% on an adjusted basis during its first fiscal quarter.

But both companies have invested significant amounts to reach that point. Walmart's online grocery ordering and pickup have expanded to over 1,800 stores already. It also offers delivery from over 320 stores. Kroger offers free pickup at over 1,250 stores, and it started testing online shipped-to-door sales earlier this month. All of those investments in making it easier for customers to shop online seem aimed directly at Amazon.

Unlike smaller competitors like Trader Joe's, both companies have the scale and resources to make those investments. The cash and scale needed to invest in things like store-to-door delivery are what Amazon brings to Whole Foods, which has roughly the same number of stores as Trader Joe's. That could put further pressure on Trader Joe's as Amazon expands Whole Foods' online ordering capabilities.

Amazon will surely continue to put pressure on Walmart, Kroger, and other big national chains, and they'll have to keep investing to stay ahead of Whole Foods. In the short term, however, it appears Amazon's success will come at the expense of smaller, urban-focused grocers and convenience stores. Meanwhile, Amazon investors should be ready for long-term investments to start taking share from the big national players.

Ex-CEO sues Barnes & Noble over ouster linked to alleged harassment



By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc was sued on Tuesday by a former chief executive officer who said the largest U.S. bookstore chain falsely accused him of violating its sexual harassment policy before firing him after 14 months on the job.

In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Demos Parneros accused Barnes & Noble of breach of contract and defamation over his sudden July 3 termination without severance.

He also said Barnes & Noble falsely accused him of mistreating then-Chief Financial Officer Allen Lindstrom, who Parneros considered a ""poor performer"" on business-related matters, according to the complaint. Lindstrom and two others now share the CEO role.

Lindstrom was not immediately available to comment.

In a statement, Barnes & Noble's board of directors called Parneros' lawsuit ""an attempt to extort money from the company by a CEO who was terminated for sexual harassment, bullying behavior and other violations of company policies.""

The board said Riggio ""upholds the highest standards of integrity and decency,"" and called Parneros' allegations about him ""replete with lies and mischaracterizations.""

Parneros said he had not violated company policies and ""always conducted himself in a professional manner.""

He is seeking more than $4 million of severance, plus other compensatory and punitive damages. Parneros' lawyer, Debra Raskin, declined to elaborate on the complaint.

Barnes & Noble has been struggling with years of falling sales and foot traffic as Amazon.com Inc and other rivals take away business.

Parneros joined in late 2016 as chief operating officer, after 28 years at Staples Inc, and succeeded Riggio as CEO six months later.

According to the complaint, Riggio became ""extremely upset"" when the takeover bid fell through, believing it denied him a ""graceful exit"" from the company.

The complaint said Riggio stopped returning Parneros' phone calls and texts, while continuing to meet with other executives, despite there being ""no suggestion"" Parneros was at fault.

But Parneros said Riggio told him on July 2 he would be ""fired for cause for violating the sexual harassment policy and cited his interactions with an executive assistant and purported mistreatment of Allen Lindstrom.""

Barnes & Noble's announcement of Parneros' termination said it was for ""violations of the company's policies,"" and not disagreement over its financial practices.

The complaint said Barnes & Noble's ""defamatory statements have caused Parneros significant injury.""

The case is Parneros v Barnes & Noble Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-07834.

Most of the surge was powered by big gains in large-capitalization technology and Internet stocks and is the latest sign that the longest bull market in Wall Street history remains healthy (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in Longest Bull Market ).The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts. Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump's tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.Further, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks also provide nice boost to Nasdaq.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/vmware-to-acquire-venture-cap-backed-cloudhealth-technology-cm1014170,"VMware VMW recently announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire CloudHealth Technologies, a provider of a platform for multi-cloud operations. Notably, the latter has received funding from eminent venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, Meritech, Sapphire Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, .406 Ventures and Sigma Prime Ventures. The deal amount as reported by Reuters is $500 million.





CloudHealth has operations across platforms like Microsoft's MSFT Azure, Amazon AMZN AWS as well as Alphabet's GOOGL Google Cloud and has a huge base of more than 3000 global customers. The platform enables customers to optimize cost related to cloud usage, performance and security for ""native public cloud"" infrastructure.The addition of solutions offered by CloudHealth Technologies is expected to enhance VMware's capabilities to address multi-cloud environment related problems. This, in turn, is expected to boost the company's share price momentum going ahead.Notably, the stock has gained 43% over the past year, outperforming the 37% rally of the industry it belongs to.





How is VMware Poised?



VMware has been gaining from robust performance of NSX and vSAN product lines. Notably, nine out of the top 10 enterprise agreements in the company's second-quarter of fiscal 2019 included NSX. VMware stated that 82 companies of the Fortune 100 have adopted NSX.



VMware is well poised to benefit from the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. The company has been consistently taking initiatives to diversify its product portfolio to include most of the IT infrastructure. Acquisitions of Desktone and Airwatch have significantly strengthened its position in this regard.



VMware also reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis.



However, VMware's margins are expected to be dampened by heavy spending. Intensifying competition is also a concern. The stiff competitive environment hurts VMware's pricing power, which impacts profitability. Additionally, longer sales cycles remain a headwind for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/nasdaq-crosses-8000-mark-play-5-top-ranked-stocks-cm1014171,"On Aug 27, the Nasdaq Composite hit a new milestone, crossing the 8,000 mark. In trade-war inflicted 2018, the Nasdaq Composite has been the best performer among the top three U.S. indices with year-to-date returns of 14.4%, which trumped the Dow Jones' 4.9% return and the S&P 500's 7.5% gain.

The tech-heavy index scaled the latest high mainly on solid gains in some big tech names and subsiding trade disputes between the United States and Mexico.

FAANGs in Fashion

FAANGs - Facebook FB (up 1.6%), Apple AAPL (up about 0.8%), Amazon AMZN (up 1.2%), Netflix NFLX (up about 1.61%) and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL (up about 1.6%) - stayed strong on Aug 27. If this was not enough, Apple became the first U.S. trillion-dollar company this month. Since FAANGs are instrumental in driving the index, the latest rally in those stocks was all the more reason for the Nasdaq to scale higher.

Cyclical Nature of the Sector

A pickup in the global economy is great for a cyclical sector like technology. Such sectors perform better in a rising rate environment that is currently being witnessed in the United States. Apart from technology, the Nasdaq index has considerable weight in another cyclical sector -Consumer Discretionary. After all, with the U.S. economy growing at a solid clip and job growth remaining steady, it makes sense to cash in on the amazing growth momentum (read: What Rising Rates? Play These Cyclical ETFs ).

Upbeat Earnings

The Technology sector (77.8% companies have already reported) came up with an earnings beat ratio of 89.8% and revenue beat ratio of 83.7% in Q2. Tech earnings rose 34.4% in the quarter on 12.8% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on Aug 9.

Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary (91.2% companies reported so far) logged a 67.7% earnings beat ratio and a 51.6% revenue beat ratio. The sector's earnings and revenue growth was 19.6% and 5.9%, respectively.

U.S.-Mexico Trade Deal

Plus, the overall market got an added impetus on Aug 27 from easing trade tensions between the United States and Mexico as the duo agreed on a new bilateral trade deal. Tensions between the countries have been rife since President Trump's election campaign days. So, some negotiations on this front bode well for the markets.

Will the Bull Run Continue?

While many are jittery about stretched valuation and a '2000-style crash' of Nasdaq, most experts are of the opinion that these fears are groundless. Bespoke Investment Group noted that in 1999-2000, the surge was all about tech but the latest run consists of "" tech and a lot of other companies ."" It speaks more of fundamental strength.

Still, we highlight below a few top-ranked stocks from the Nasdaq which have a P/E ratio less than that of Nasdaq-100 ETF Invesco QQQ QQQ (22.8x).

PCM Inc. PCMI - P/E (F1) 10.64x

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/reasons-why-investors-should-steer-clear-of-jakks-pacific-cm1014018,"Not exempting the current fate of U.S. toymakers, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. JAKK is plagued with declining consumer demand and sales crunch. Further, the company has been witnessing a dismal earnings trend. It reported lower-than-expected bottom line for the six straight quarters.

A look at JAKKS Pacific's price trend reveals that the stock has witnessed an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past year. Shares of the company have lost 25.8% against the industry 's rally of 14.7% in the same time frame. This reflects investors' pessimism on the stock, given the uncertain sales environment.

Let's delve deeper into factors that suggest that you should steer clear of the stock now.





Source: https://www.zacks.com



Lower Demand Hurts Revenues

For quite some time, JAKK Pacific is facing a declining demand for its products. Like most other traditional toymakers, the company competes with a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices. Due to the shift in demand patterns of kids, the company's revenues are pressurized and are not likely to recover soon. In the second quarter of 2018, net sales declined 11.5% from the year-ago level. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $586.3 million, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 4.4%.

Rising Costs Affect Profits & Returns

Although JAKKS Pacific's initiatives to boost sales - including the launch of products - and the shift toward more technology-driven toys to revive its brands would aid profits in the long term; costs related to those would hurt the company in the near term.

In the second quarter, gross margin was 26.4%, down 180 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. The metric was negatively impacted by rise in sales reserves and lower selling prices for certain licensed products at the end of the reporting cycle. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for 2018 is pegged at loss of 88 cents per share.

Furthermore, JAKK Pacific's trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. Its ROE of a negative 39.1% compares unfavorably with the industry's average of 14.6%, reflecting the fact that it is less efficient in using shareholders' funds.







Toys ""R"" Us Liquidation Effect to Continue

The U.S. toy industry was taken by surprise when the country's largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy in last September. The toy chain also confirmed that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operations (735 Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us stores).

JAKKS Pacific, along with other toymakers like Mattel MAT and Hasbro HAS , is affected and is likely to continue to be impacted as a considerable portion of their revenues have been generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon AMZN have come to rescue these toymakers, those currently don't have shelf spaces as big as Toys ""R"" Us, which is a concern.

On a year-over-year basis, JAKKS Pacific's net revenues in the first and second quarter of 2018 declined a respective 1.4% and 11.5% due to the liquidation. Toys ""R"" Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys. We believe the effect of this liquidation is likely to linger further and the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time in the future.

JAKK Pacific has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Recently, AWS announced that it has made its Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) available on VMware.

The new service will enable customers to set up, operate, and scale databases in VMware-based software-defined data centers and hybrid environments, and also migrate these to AWS or VMware Cloud on AWS with complete ease.

In addition, Amazon RDS on VMware will support Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB databases over the coming months.

The latest move will expand the customer base of the company, which will in turn drive its top-line growth. Moreover, this will strengthen the company's market position.

Shares of Amazon have outperformed its industry on a 12-month basis. The stock has registered a gain of 92.5% compared with the industry 's growth of 44.6%.

Growth Prospects in Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure

Per Gartner, 90% organizations will adopt hybrid infrastructure by 2020. Cloud compute services are expected to grow from $23.3 billion in 2016 to $68.4 billion in 2020. Hosting and collocation spending is expected to surge to $74.5 billion in 2020 from $53.9 billion in 2016. Infrastructure Utility Service (IUS) is projected to grow from $21.3 billion in 2016 to $37 billion in 2020. Storage as a service will rise from $1.7 billion in 2016 to $2.7 billion in 2020.

We expect both the companies to gain momentum from the growth prospects offered by the sector and their own ability to make the most out of it.

Growing Clientele to Aid Market Expansion

AWS is gaining traction with its expanding clientele, courtesy of its continuous efforts to improve offerings.

Recently, the company has acquired quite a few clients, in sync with its dominant market share. It has acquired a client namely Samsung Heavy Industries, which leverages the power of Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Key Management Service and AWS CloudTrail for its smart shipping systems division. Its other important clients include Disney, Expedia EXPE , Comcast, GE, Salesforce.com, Workday and Netflix NFLX , which will continue to bolster share in the Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market.

High performance rate and rapid deployment capability has made AWS' tools desirable for small businesses as well as enterprises. Moreover, Amazon's continuing investments for infrastructure development are aiding growth on a global basis.

These factors are helping AWS to not only attract new customers but also entice the existing ones to expand their usage of Amazon's wide range of services across computing, storage, database, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, Internet of Things (IoT), security and enterprise applications.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/e-commerce-continues-to-drive-walmart-soft-margins-a-worry-cm1013993,"Walmart Inc.WMT , which has taken aggressive e-commerce strategies to counter the growing dominance of Amazon AMZN , has gained close to 23% in a year's time compared with the industry 's growth of almost 26%. In fact, there have been rounds in this regard that Moosejaw, which was acquired by Walmart last year, will feature on Walmart's website. The move comes as part of Walmart's constant efforts to strengthen its digital marketplace and boost online traffic.





E-Commerce Game On



Well, Walmart has long been undertaking efforts including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems to enhance its online operations in order to stay firm in its race with Amazon. To this end, the company recently revealed intentions to establish a five-year strategic partnership with Microsoft MSFT . The deal is likely to strengthen Walmart's digital capabilities through Microsoft's strength in providing advanced cloud solutions. Also, Walmart clinched contracts to buy a 77% stake in India's leading e-commerce name, Flipkart, which is likely to conclude soon. Though the deal is expected to hurt the bottom line in the short run, it is likely to bolster Walmart's e-commerce sales in the long run.



Apart from this, Walmart's buyouts of ShoeBuy, Bonobos, ModCloth and Jet.com, and deals with Rakuten, and Lord and Taylor underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company's latest plans to venture into the subscription-based video streaming arena and Walmart2World money transfer service along with Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business, and making shopping easier and faster. Apart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.



Online Grocery a Major Driver



Given the rising demand for online grocery, this world's largest retailer remains committed to enrich consumers' experiences by providing easy shopping methods and seamless grocery deliveries. To this end, Walmart recently raised its stake in Dada-JD Daojia to 10%, in a move to strengthen its last-mile delivery service and further enhance omni-channel offering. In an earlier development, Walmart inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States.



Other than this, the company's contract with DoorDash and acquisition of last-mile delivery service Parcel highlights its focus on enhancing grocery sales. Further, the company's Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In earlier developments, Walmart also tested same-day delivery with Deliv. We believe that these actions help the company offer multiple choices to online grocery shoppers amid increasing competition from Amazon. Apart from Walmart, retail behemoths like Kroger KR and Target TGT are also trying all means to expand their online grocery operations.



Coming back to Walmart, such aforementioned endeavors helped its U.S. e-commerce sales soar 40% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, much better than a 33% rise reported in the first quarter. E-commerce sales improved on the back of enhanced online assortment with 1,100 new renowned brands and increased grocery pickups. These factors keep management encouraged about achieving 40% U.S. e-commerce sales growth in fiscal 2019.



E-commerce Growth Comes at the Cost of Margins



While Walmart's online strategies have been driving its business, costs associated with investments in e-commerce expansion and technological advancements; the mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and Walmart's compelling pricing strategy have been weighing on its margins. Evidently, these factors caused the company's gross margin to contract 11 basis points (bps), 29 bps and 61 bps in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. In first-quarter fiscal 2019, gross margin shrank 15 bps. It contracted 17 bps in the second quarter due to price investments in various markets and increased transportation costs.



Management earlier projected margins to remain pressurized in fiscal 2019. Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's superb e-commerce strategies along with its other sales driving efforts should help it combat these hurdles.

It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.



And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

With thousands of companies to choose from, the temptation to go with stocks that have a good story becomes irresistible to many investors.

Perhaps the best way to begin, however, is to decide what you don't want to invest in -- to whittle down the vast universe of stocks to a more manageable size by first eliminating companies you just won't touch. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) , and Qudian (NYSE: QD) are three stocks I've crossed off my list. Here's why I'd hate to buy these businesses today:

Facebook

For years, Facebook has benefited from astronomical user growth, but more recently has run into trouble because of policies that control what users are able to see and that undermine their privacy. It added only 22 million users worldwide last quarter, its smallest increase since 2011, when such data first became available.

But it's not just the number of users Facebook is attracting that is the problem. Although still a dominant online advertising force, it is losing ad market share to Amazon.com , its video platform Watch has yet to attract any kind of audience, and its Stories feature hasn't been used on its flagship platform like it has with its other property, Instagram, and Snap , from which it stole the idea.

It is investing a lot of money in the service, causing it to forecast lower revenue growth, but it's not getting much payoff -- all the while coming under greater scrutiny from politicians here at home and from regulators abroad.

Facebook's stock has lost 20% of its value since reporting earnings, and until it can prove it can pull some growth levers once more, this is a stock I plan to stay away from.

J.C. Penney

Former J.C. Penney CEO Ron Johnson moved too fast when making changes at the stumbling old-line retailer, as he tried to drag it into the 21st century. His successor Marvin Ellison moved too slowly. Management kept struggling stores for far too long, and let the locations drain profits and crimp the company's recovery.

Ellison was something of a stabilizing force at J.C. Penney. But he lacked experience in apparel retailing, the skill set essential to attracting the department store chain's primary customer. Penney is undergoing an executive search to replace Ellison after he jumped to Lowe's , an environment he's much more comfortable with, and the company says apparel experience is guiding the company's search.

A new executive may make the whole more cohesive, but the core middle-aged mom whom it wants to target may have already abandoned the retailer. Where J.C. Penney is struggling to show positive same-store sales, rivals Kohl's and Macy's are chugging along.

There are too many questions facing J.C. Penney at the moment to make an investment here anything more than a gamble on the fact that this time, management will get it right.

Qudian

It's been almost a year since its IPO, and Chinese online payday lender Qudian has seen its stock lose over three quarters of its value. Although its story looked good at the outset, the reality has been anything but , as regulators have cracked down on the type of business it operates.

A growing Chinese economy has seen wages rising, along with an increased consumerist mentality. But youthful desires for acquiring things don't match up with the requisite credit profile needed to qualify for a loan. Enter payday lenders like Qudian, which, when it went public, was lending an average $136 in cash loans and typically seeing them paid back in two months.

However, last December the Chinese government issued new regulations on such activities, and the impact was swift. Qudian says the number of transactions fell 8% in the first quarter while the number of borrowers tumbled over 13%. Credit drawdowns plunged 44%.

Although Qudian says it ""proactively and swiftly de-risked from an industrywide credit downturn"" that resulted from the new regulations, the damage has been done. The stock is down 83% from the highs it hit right after its IPO, and there seems little chance it will recover anytime in the future, near or otherwise.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/whats-next-for-facebook-fb-stock-one-month-after-its-historic-decline-cm1013829,"It has been roughly one month since Facebook FB reported second-quarter financial results that sent many investors running. So let's evaluate Facebook since its infamous July 25 earnings release.

User Growth Woes

Facebook saw its second-quarter revenues soar by 42% to hit $13.23 billion, while its quarterly earnings jumped by 32%. Both were impressive for a company making that kind of money. But investors didn't care about Facebook's strong top and bottom line expansion because of its slowing user growth.

Mark Zuckerberg's company saw its daily active user totals in Europe fall from 282 million in Q1 to 279 million. Facebook also experienced a sequential decline in terms of monthly active users in this key region. Meanwhile, Facebook saw its DAUs climb by just about 1% in the U.S. and Canada to close the quarter with 185 million. Plus, at 241 million, MAU's were also flat from Q1 and up only 2% from the year-ago quarter.

It is worth noting that Facebook expanded both its MAU and DAUs in its Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of the World"" regions. However, this growth did little to calm investors since the U.S., Canada, and Europe generated roughly 72% of FB's total Q2 revenues, while only making up approximately 28% of Facebook's total monthly active users.

Clearly, investors and Facebook don't want to see its user totals start to plateau in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Luckily, the firm still offers advertisers access to consumers that are harder and harder to reach during the age of Netflix NFLX , Amazon AMZN Prime, and increasingly decentralized media. Therefore, Facebook and Google GOOGL will likely continue to grab a huge chunk of total U.S. ad dollars, which is vital to the company that makes nearly 99% of its revenues from advertising.

But the bad news didn't stop at the company's slowing user growth, which is inevitable for a company that boasts 2.23 billion MAUs. Facebook's CFO David Wehner-in a moment he might now regret- said that the company expects its operating margins will fall into the ""mid-30s on a percentage basis"" over the next several years. The executive also noted that Facebook expects its ""total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019.""

Wehner's operating margin projection, more than anything else, might have caused the massive post-earnings release selloff. The truly scary part for investors is that Facebook posted an operating margin of 44% in Q2, which was already down from 47% in the prior-year quarter.

""Fake News"" Problem

Facebook noted that major investments in augmented and virtual reality as well as marketing and content acquisition will contribute to its declining profitability. The firm's CFO also said that spending on safety and security is set to surge. In fact, ""safety, security and privacy"" was one of the first things that Zuckerberg spoke about on FB's Q2 conference call.

The company hopes to make its platform more transparent and limit the spreading of misinformation, which became a huge point of contention that forced Facebook's CEO to testify in front of members of Congress earlier this year.

Looking Ahead

Facebook suffered the largest-ever one-day loss in market value for a U.S.-listed company following its quarterly earnings release in late July. Shares of FB plummeted 19% in one day, which erased roughly $119 billion market cap.

Investors will notice that Facebook stock has hardly recovered since its huge drop off despite news that it is actively trying to enter new potential growth areas. Facebook reportedly has been in talks with JPMorgan Chase JPM , Wells Fargo WFC , and Citigroup C to see if the banking giants would be open to partnerships to help increase user engagement.

Facebook, along with Twitter TWTR and other social media companies, has added more live video offerings, which might prove vital as a growing number of people and even governments become more concerned about cellphone addiction. Facebook needs to be able to offer users more than the ability to endlessly scroll through posts, which live video, from news to sports, could provide.

Outlook

Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Facebook's third-quarter revenues to jump 34% to reach $13.83 billion. FB's revenues are projected to hit $55.46 billion in fiscal 2018, which would mark over a 36% climb. Meanwhile, Facebook's adjusted Q3 earnings are expected to sink nearly 7%.

Facebook's earnings estimate revision activity has also trended almost completely downward for Q3 and for fiscal 2018 and 2019, over the last 60 days, which helps give Facebook its current Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) standing. Investors might want to stay away from FB stock at the moment since it wouldn't be surprising to see further declines.

The State Department also said it would push foreign postal services to furnish data that would help customs officials detect opioids and other illegal shipments entering the United States. That task could also add to their costs.

If successful, the effort would benefit U.S. merchants and shippers who say they are undercut by foreign postal services’ access to low rates. U.S. shoppers could see higher bills for foreign goods ordered online.

The move may face pushback during meetings next month of the United Nation’s Universal Postal Union, from countries like China and Brazil, which already face price hikes for mail to Europe and the United States.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on “terminal dues,” or rates one country’s postal service pays another for finishing an international delivery.

“The current system of terminal dues distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the shipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates,” the memo said.

It added that the U.S. Secretary of State “shall include recommendations for future action, including the possibility of adopting self-declared rates,” if insufficient progress is made with the Universal Postal Union.

The policy makes Trump a surprise ally of Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, which he has accused of turning the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) into its “delivery boy.”

Amazon did not return a request for comment. UPS called the administration’s actions “a positive step” toward addressing “longstanding imbalances in the global postal market.”

https://reuters.com//article/legal-us-otc-amazon/is-amazon-liable-for-selling-defective-products-three-appeals-courts-will-decide-idUSKCN1L51WM,"(Reuters) - In September 2016, William Foley took a drag on his vaping device and nearly burned down his house in La Miranda, California. Foley’s home insurer, State Farm, paid Foley more than $400,000 for repairs and related expenses. The insurer contends the fire was caused by a defective LG battery in Foley’s vaping device. Last month, State Farm lawyers at Pillemer & Pillemer filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking to recoup the money it paid on Foley’s claim.

The suit, which was removed earlier this month to federal district court in Los Angeles, names not just LG as a defendant, though. State Farm is also suing Amazon, which it blames for selling Foley the allegedly defective batteries in his vaping device. Amazon, represented by Friedenthal, Heffernan & Brown, said in an answer filed last week that it neither designed, manufactured nor sold the batteries. The online retailer also said it’s shielded by the Communications Decency Act, which protects online publishers from claims based on content provided by someone else.

Obviously, if State Farm were to manage to pin liability on Amazon, the consequences would huge. But don’t go selling your Amazon shares just yet. At least four previous plaintiffs have attempted to hold Amazon responsible for selling a defective product. So far, none has won.

Three of those cases are now before federal appellate courts in the 3rd, 4th and 6th Circuits. The next several months, in other words, are a bit of an appellate crucible for Amazon. If all three federal circuits uphold lower-court rulings that the company is not liable for selling defective products, Amazon will have pretty well squelched the threat of an onslaught of product liability suits. But if even one of circuits goes the other way, it’s a good bet that consumers and insurers like State Farm will sit up and take notice.

The 3rd Circuit will hear oral arguments on Oct. 5 in Oberdorf v. Amazon, in which U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, granted summary judgment to Amazon last December. The litigation stems from a horrible accident. Heather Oberdorf was walking her dog in 2015 when the dog’s retractable leash snapped back and hit her in the face, causing permanent damage to her eyesight. Oberdorf had purchased the leash through Amazon, but Judge Brann held the company isn’t liable as a seller under Pennsylvania law because it has no role in the manufacture or selection of goods sold by vendors on the site.

“The Amazon Marketplace serves as a sort of newspaper classified ad section, connecting potential consumers with eager sellers in an efficient, modern, streamlined manner,” the judge wrote. He also agreed with Amazon that the Communications Decency Act’s safe harbor for online publishers protects the retailer from liability.

At the 4th Circuit, appellate briefing is complete in Erie v. Amazon, which stems from Erie Insurance’s coverage for a house fire blamed on a faulty headlamp. U.S. District Judge Roger Titus of Greenbelt, Maryland, ruled in January that Amazon’s online marketplace functions differently than, for instance, Home Depot. If Erie’s policyholder were to have purchased the headlamp at Home Depot, the judge acknowledged, Home Depot could be held liable for selling it. But Amazon said clearly on its website that headlamp maker – and not Amazon itself – was selling the product. Amazon simply facilitated the sale, Judge Titus said, by storing and delivering the product and remitting payment to the seller.

“The vast majority of cases, both inside this circuit and outside of it, have concluded that under the circumstances of this case, Amazon cannot and must not be viewed as a seller of the head light,” the judge said. “Amazon did not manufacture, sell, deliver or offer this for sale product and the information about the product including price was created and uploaded by the seller. And, therefore, Amazon was not the seller.”

The 6th Circuit appeal was just filed in late June, after U.S. District Judge William Campbell of Nashville concluded Amazon was not responsible for selling a hoverboard that allegedly triggered the fire that burned down the home of Charles and Megan Fox. Judge Campbell held Amazon does not fit Tennessee’s definition of a seller. “Amazon did not hold title to the product sold here, did not set the price of the product, and did not create the text describing or making representations about the product,” he wrote. “Amazon’s role in the transaction was to provide a mechanism to facilitate the interchange between the entity seeking to sell the product and the individual who sought to buy it.” (The judge also rejected the Foxes’ theory that Amazon failed to warn buyers about problems with hoverboard batteries even after the company conducted its own extensive safety review.

Broadly speaking, the plaintiffs who want to hold Amazon responsible for providing the allegedly defective products are arguing that courts should not allow the company to evade liability through the technical loophole of its relationship with its vendors. For all practical purposes, they contend, Amazon is a seller, just like any retailer that distributes products made by other manufacturers. Amazon, represented in all three appeals by Perkins Coie, counters that its business model is fundamentally different from that of traditional retailers: It provides an online storefront and back-end services to more than a million vendors, but it does not sell their products itself so cannot be held responsible when those products are defective.

So far, Amazon’s position has carried the day. We’ll see if the company fares as well in the circuits as it has in trial courts.",2018-08-20,Amazon
https://reuters.com//article/us-amazon-insurance-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-considering-uk-insurance-comparison-site-sources-idUSKBN1L10HS,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is sounding out some of Europe’s top insurance firms to see if they would contribute products to a UK price comparison website in what would be a major foray by the U.S. online retail giant into the region’s financial services.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo

Three industry executives told Reuters they had held talks with Amazon about the possible launch of a site. One said the talks were part of several discussions Amazon is having with insurers. A second said there were no imminent launch plans.

While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites.

“As Amazon becomes a larger part of the home, whether it’s products delivered to the home, security monitoring, home services like Wi-Fi installation, you can make the case that insurance is the next logical step for this company,” said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy.

The industry sources declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Amazon declined to comment.

An Amazon price comparison website for insurance products would be a potential challenge to existing UK sites given the U.S. company’s cutting-edge technology, reach and loyal customer base.

Two of the most high profile are comparethemarket.com which shows products from insurers including AXA (AXAF.PA), Hastings (HSTG.L) and eSure (ESUR.L); and GoCompare (GOCO.L), which lists insurance from firms such as Santander (SAN.MC) and LV= [LV.UL].

In response to the prospect of Amazon launching a rival service, shares in Moneysupermarket (MONY.L), GoCompare and Admiral (ADML.L), which runs the confused.com site, were down between 1.6 percent and 4.6 percent on Thursday.

A UK insurance site would also build on Amazon’s existing products in Europe offering extensions to manufacturers’ warranties, a service known as Amazon Protect.

While Amazon’s loyal customer base and reach would probably prove attractive to some insurers happy to cede some of their premiums to Amazon to expand sales, the potential for premiums to be forced lower through competition could deter others.

One of the industry sources said the comparison site model fitted Amazon’s strategy of offering a range of products, as opposed to partnering with one firm.

A price comparison website in particular could also be used to help drive traffic to its other marketplaces, Hottovy said.

It was not immediately clear what financial arrangements Amazon would strike with insurers if it were to go ahead.

Tech-rival Google launched a financial services comparison site in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2016 but shut it down after only a year due to low traffic.

REGULATORY BURDEN

In the United States, Amazon has a joint venture with insurer Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and JP Morgan (JPM.N) aimed at slashing U.S. healthcare costs. It also offers a small business loan program.

In Europe, Amazon has had a partnership with The Warranty Group since 2016 to offer the warranty extensions. It also offers co-branded credit cards in the United Kingdom and Germany although it does not lend money of its own.

In a sign of potential expansion plans, Amazon began to place job ads last year for staff for a new insurance business in Europe, without giving details.

While Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) have large finance arms, leading Western tech firms have taken a more cautious approach to heavily regulated financial services, which often have hefty capital requirements.

A comparison site, however, would let Amazon give its customers access to insurance from a variety of providers while avoiding that level of regulatory burden, industry sources said.

The use of comparison websites to buy motor and home insurance is more prevalent in the United Kingdom than Europe or the United States.

Some insurers rely heavily on comparison websites for sales. UK insurer Hastings (HSTG.L), for example, told Reuters it sells 90 percent of its motor policies through such sites.

Per an analysis by Equinor, the Snorre and Gulfaks fields in the Tampen area in the northern North sea are best suited for this initiative. The study was made to ascertain which oil and gas installations on the NCS are appropriate for power supply from a floating offshore wind farm.



Further, evaluation is required to be carried out related to a wind farm solution, which willcomprise11 wind turbines based on Equinor's floating offshore wind concept, Hywind. The 8 megawatt turbines will have a total capacity of 88 megawatt. The turbines are projected to meet about 35% of the annual power demand of the Snorre A and Bas well as Gullfaks A, B and C platforms. When the wind speed is higher the percentage will increase considerably. The partners of the fields will progress with the project and an investment decision is likely to be taken in 2019.



The partners in the Gullfaks license include Equinor, Petoro and OMV (Norge) AS. The partners in the Snorre license comprise Equinor, Petoro AS, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM , Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS, DEA Norge AS and Point Resources AS.



Project Benefits



The Hywind Tampen project is estimated to lower CO2 emissions by more than 200,000 tons per year, which corresponds to emissions from 100,000 cars as well as reduce the use of gas turbines. The project, which is likely to be the first offshore wind farm, is directly linked to oil and gas platforms as well as pave way for new industrial prospects for Norway. Other benefits from this project include further development of floating offshore wind technology, cost cuts and creation of more competitive solutions. From 2020 to 2030, the Tampen project will lower CO2 emissions on the Norwegian continental shelf by 2.5 million tons per year.



Project Financing



The partners have estimated the initial capital and development expenditures of the project at about NOK 5 billion ($602.2 million) along with further cost cuts. The industry's NOx fund is likely to provide about NOK 566 million as investment support for the project.



Moreover, Norwegian authority has opened avenues aid innovative offshore wind projects related to the oil and gas industry through offshore wind strategy and Enova.



Owned by the Ministry of Climate and Environment, Enova contributes in lowering greenhouse gas emissions, development of energy and climate technology along with strengthening the supply system.



Price Performance



In the past year, Equinor's shares have surged 40.7% compared with the industry 's 27.3% rise.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/bp-plc-stock-has-become-one-of-better-picks-energy-patch-cm1014467,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In terms of energy stocks, two names come to mind when thinking of stereotypical whipping boys. One would be Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK ). The other would be integrated giant BP plc (NYSE: BP ). Both have had their shares of up and downs. And both have spent the last few years scraping by while being vilified by various pundits. But while CHK has started to get its act together, BP has already broken free of its former shackles.

The integrated energy stock is making acquisitions, seeing returning cash flows and, perhaps more importantly, restarting its stagnating dividend payout.

For investors, BP and its return to glory represent a great play in the energy patch. The best part is that the firm is just starting to see the fruits of its labor. There's plenty of runway left for BP.

A Great Quarter at BP

It's been a long time since I - or, really, most investors - have been excited about BP. After all, BP has spent the better half of the decade cleaning up and paying for the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill. If you remember, that was the worst oil spill in history and has cost the firm billions of dollars in legal fees, remediation costs and fines. And since the spill - which happened back in 2010 - BP shares have kind of been in a funk.

Much of the firm's cash flows went towards paying for the disaster and, as a result, its dividend was left out to pasture, CAPEX and exploration budgets were slashed and buybacks were suspended. Even worse was that oil prices began to crater about halfway through BP's journey through paying for the disaster.

Naturally, the outlook seemed bleak for BP. The energy giant even was considered a buyout candidate for a larger rival like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) or Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A , NYSE: RDS.B ).

But all of the heartaches seem to be going away. BP is back in a major way.

Just take a look at its latest quarter. Thanks to the spill, BP was forced to become ""lean and mean."" It had to cut costs, reduce CAPEX and only focus on the most profitable drilling locations/fields. It simply didn't have the wiggle room to take big bets that could take years, or might never, pay off. Because of this cost-cutting, BP has benefited immensely now that oil prices have been rising. It's basically been able to squeeze more out of each barrel.

For the quarter, BP realized profits of $2.87 billion. This compares to the measly $156 million it managed to make in the same period last year. Revenues also surged. More importantly, it builds on the previous two-quarters great earnings.

The Reason to Be Excited at BP

Those consecutive great quarters at the energy firm have also done another amazing thing. Operational cash flows are very much in the black. Cash flow positive is now the name of the game for many stocks. For BP, this means having enough money to fund future drilling activities. Money in equals money out. And BP has it.

Over the last 3-months , BP has managed to produce more than $6.31 billion in operating cash flows. This builds upon the nearly $10 billion in operating cash flows that BP recorded over the previous two quarters. The beauty is that this cash flow generation at BP is now more than enough to fully cover current capital expenditure programs with plenty of extra.

And the company is finally sharing that extra with investors.

BP managed to increase its dividend for the first time since 2014 - by 2.5% - on the back of these higher cash flows. Additionally, the energy producer also increased the size of its buyback program and purchased another $200 million shares on the open market. This is truly wonderful news, as it was only at the end of 2017 that BP ended its script dividend program - allowing shareholders to receive dividend payments in additional shares rather than cash. That was basically done because BP didn't really have the funds on hand to pay out. Now, BP not only has the cash on hand, but enough to actually give investors more.

In fact, BP is producing so much cash, it's doing something else it hasn't done in years - make a major acquisition . In this case, it comes from paying $10.5 billion for BHP Billiton's (NYSE: BHP ) shale assets in the U.S. Thanks to the oil spill and its costs, BP was late to the shale party and was lacking exposure. But with its cash flows now rocking, BP has been able to snag some quality and substantial assets that instantly make it a prime shale player. Those assets should help it advance its low-cost mantra and boost oil production further.

Buying BP Stock

It's true: BP has finally turned the corner. Years of suffering at the hands of lower oil prices and high costs related to the spill are finally over. Just take a look at its cash flows and what the company has been able to do with them. We're finally getting buybacks, dividend increases and even spending money to grow. And, yet, it seems that investors are treating BP like the pariah it once was.

Shares can be had for a measly forward price-earnings ratio of just 12 .

That's dirt cheap for any stock, let alone one that is finally seeing real cash flow and earnings growth. I suspect that BP shares won't be that cheap for long - especially if oil prices continues to be high and its earnings continue to grow.

In the end, BP is finally making the right moves to warrant a position.

As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-top-dividend-stocks-cm1013730,"The energy sector has been good to dividend investors over the years as companies operating in the industry tend to generate lots of cash, which allows them to pay lucrative and growing dividends. While the sector offers income-seekers a variety of opportunities, three top options to consider are ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) , and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) . Not only do all three currently offer above-average payouts, but they have the financial strength and visible growth prospects to continue increasing their dividends in the coming years.

The high-yielding oil giant

ExxonMobil currently yields an attractive 4.1%, which is more than double the average of stocks in the S&P 500 . Not only does Exxon offer investors a high-yield dividend , but it has been an excellent dividend growth stock over the years, with the oil giant increasing its payout for a remarkable 36 consecutive years. That's very impressive considering that the last several years have been brutal on the oil industry due to low oil prices .

Image source: Getty Images.

However, with oil prices on the upswing, ExxonMobil's dividend not only appears to be on solid ground but should continue rising. Driving that view is the company's bold expansion plan , which will see it grow output 25% by 2025. That plan would also see the company more than double earnings and cash flow from 2017's level, and that's assuming oil is between $60 to $65 a barrel, which is below the current range of $65 to $70, suggesting the potential for even stronger earnings growth if oil remains higher than the forecast range. That compelling combination of growth and income, when combined with the fact that Exxon has one of the highest credit ratings in the world, makes it a top dividend stock for income seekers to consider.

An outsized yield with ample upside

Midstream giant MPLX offers investors an even more attractive yield of nearly 7%, due in part to the fact that the company is a master limited partnership (MLP) and pays out a much larger percentage of its cash flow than most other companies. On top of that outsized yield, the pipeline company also has a long history of raising its payout, with it recently notching its 22nd consecutive quarterly increase this past July.

MPLX should have no problem continuing to boost its payout given its strong financial profile and growth prospects. The company currently expects to finish about $2 billion of expansion projects in 2018, which should fuel 10% distribution growth for the year. Meanwhile, it recently announced plans to expand its infrastructure in the Permian Basin and Marcellus Shale via several new projects. On top of that, the company's oil refining parent is in the process of acquiring a rival , which will bring several additional midstream assets into the fold as well as control over another MLP that it could eventually merge with MPLX. The upside from those expansion opportunities position MPLX to continue increasing its payout at a healthy rate.

Image source: Getty Images.

The fuel to continue growing

While Phillips 66 offers the lowest yielding dividend within this trio, at 2.7%, it's still well above the average of stocks in the S&P 500. Further, the oil refining company has been a top-notch dividend growth stock since its inception in 2012, increasing the payout eight times so far, and by a 27% compound annual growth rate.

Phillips 66 shouldn't have any problems continuing to grow its dividend. Driving that view is the fact that the company not only recently completed several major expansion projects but has started to refill its growth engine . In addition to that, the company's MLP's are investing a significant amount of capital to drive growth . The steadily rising cash flow from those projects, when combined with Phillips 66's strong balance sheet, should continue to provide it with the financial resources to pay a growing dividend and buyback meaningful amounts of stock .

Top dividend ideas for the long haul

Aside from all operating in the energy industry, ExxonMobil, MPLX, and Phillips 66 share several other commonalities that make them excellent dividend stocks . Not only do they currently offer above-average yields, a strong balance sheet, and a long history of dividend growth, but each has clearly visible growth prospects that should drive their payouts higher. That combination of factors makes them among the top options for dividend investors to consider.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/like-dividends-i-bet-youll-love-these-3-stocks-cm1013198,"Dividends can provide more information than just a read on the income a stock will generate. Specifically, when a stock's yield is high relative to its yield history, it can indicate a buying opportunity. Yield anomalies like this are even more compelling when the company in question has a long history of annual dividend increases, too. This is why, if you like dividends, you'll love ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) , Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL) , and General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS) .

1. A plan to fix the problem

ExxonMobil is one of the largest integrated energy companies on the planet. It currently offers investors a yield of 4%, toward the high end of the company's historical yield range, which is the highest it has been since the mid-1990s. Exxon has increased its dividend annually for 36 consecutive years, including through the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014 -- something that most of its direct peers failed to do .

Image source: Getty Images.

The yield is so high because Exxon has stumbled upon hard times . Production growth has turned negative over the last couple of years (average daily production was 11% lower in the second quarter compared to 2015 levels), it hasn't been using its shareholders' money as effectively as it used to (return on capital employed has fallen from above peer levels to middle of the pack), and the fixes for these problems will take time to implement.

Things look pretty bad today. But that's exactly why you can get Exxon with a 4% dividend yield. If you are willing to take the long view and collect that relatively large yield while you wait for better days, the oil giant has a few positives to consider. For example, it remains conservative, with long-term debt at just 10% of the capital structure. And it has an impressive history of industry-leading execution, which it plans to put to better use by taking greater control of its most important growth projects. Moreover, it isn't willing to take shortcuts to appease Wall Street, focusing on the highest-value opportunities over more expedient, less profitable oil exploration .

Exxon's current investment plans reach out to 2025. By that point, the company thinks it can double earnings or more (depending on oil prices ). It's a long time to wait, but the large yield should reward investors well for their patience.

2. Protein problems

Hormel Foods is a packaged food company with a focus on meat and other proteins. The current yield is roughly 2%, low on an absolute level but at the high end of its historical yield range. The dividend has been increased for an incredible 52 consecutive years.

The food maker is facing a number of troubles today. Consumer tastes are shifting toward fresher and natural products and away from one of Hormel's most important brands, SPAM. Supply and demand have been out of balance in key businesses, including turkey. Rising costs have been difficult to pass through to customers because of low inflation. And more recently, trade tensions have led to concerns about the company's global expansion plans, notably in China.

Data source: XOM Dividend Yield (TTM). Chart by YCharts.

However, Hormel isn't sitting still. It has been shifting its portfolio for a number of years by acquiring more desirable brands like Wholly Guacamole and Columbus Meats (expanding its presence in the fast-growing deli aisle). It's also been innovating, bringing out new versions of its wares, such as Skippy P.B. Bites that turn peanut butter into a snack. And perhaps most important, it remains conservative, with long-term debt at roughly 10% of the capital structure even after relatively large acquisitions like Columbus.

There's no question that Hormel is facing troubles today, but it has industry-leading brands and the financial strength to weather a tough spell. If history is any guide, it will adjust its portfolio to meet consumer demands, supply and demand will work itself out, and it will pass rising costs on to customers eventually. In the meantime, you can collect a relatively large yield that has grown at an impressive annualized rate of 16% or more over the trailing 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (more than five times the historical rate of inflation growth ). Notably, that includes the current industry weak spell.

3. A bit more risk

Last up is General Mills, one of the world's largest packaged food companies. It has increased its dividend for just 14 consecutive years. However, a dividend has been paid without interruption for over 100 years. The yield is around 4.2% today. You have to go back to the late 1990s to see higher yields.

Like Hormel, General Mills is facing changing consumer tastes and pricing headwinds in the face of rising costs for things like shipping . And like Hormel, General Mills isn't sitting still. It has been working to cut costs and introduce new products that better align with customer tastes (such as healthy snacks and new varieties of yogurt) and has been using acquisitions to expand into new areas (Annie's and, more recently, Blue Buffalo to enter into the fast-growing healthy-pet-food space ).

With more than 100 years of history behind it, General Mills has changed with the times before and is likely to do so again this time around. However, there is one concern here that investors should watch: debt. General Mills has historically used leverage more aggressively than peers like Hormel. And the Blue Buffalo acquisition was costly, leading some to wonder if General Mills overpaid . What is for certain, however, is that long-term debt increased by around 66% in fiscal 2018 because of the pet food deal. That has investors justifiably worried.

Data source: XOM Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly). Chart by YCharts.

General Mills is aware of the issue and plans to put dividend increases on hold while it works to reduce leverage. Still, a lot is riding on this large acquisition, which the company is relying on to spur top-line growth . If you are willing to give a more-than-100-year old company the benefit of the doubt and keep a close eye on leverage, you can collect a hefty yield while you wait for it to prove that it can make Blue Buffalo work just as well as it did Annie's a few years ago.

Buying when others are fearful

There's no question that investors are worried about Exxon, Hormel, and General Mills today. There are good reasons for those concerns. However, all three are important players in their respective industries and niches and have long histories of successfully navigating problems over time. The fixes may take time to play out, but that's why long-term investors looking for dividend income have the opportunity to buy today at such high relative yields. If you can see past the current problems to a brighter future, you can benefit from investors who are thinking only about the short term.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/this-trend-could-erase-americas-energy-trade-deficit-by-2022-cm1013126,"It may be impossible to spill too much ink discussing the incredible, virtually overnight transformation in American energy trade. In 2005, the United States was the world's top net energy importer, relying on imports for 30% of its total energy and 60% of all petroleum consumption. By 2022 and perhaps sooner, Uncle Sam is expected to elbow his way to near the front of the global trade line and become a net energy exporter.

It's difficult to communicate the magnitude of the shift in American energy trade flows. Consider that energy products have been the country's single-largest trade deficit category for decades. The imbalance peaked at $321 billion in 2011, comprising more than 60% of the nation's entire trade deficit. Yet in a few short years, energy products will become one of the United States' biggest competitive advantages on the global stage.

It also creates some tremendous long-term opportunities for oil and gas stocks that only are just beginning to be exploited. Individual investors looking to share in the awesome rise of American energy may want to start paying closer attention to the trend.

Image source: Getty Images.

America as a top energy exporter? It's true.

The United States is already a net exporter of coal (since before 2000), ethanol (since 2010), petroleum products (since 2011), and natural gas (since 2017). The only major product without a positive trade balance is crude oil. The country isn't expected to become a net exporter of the latter until the 2030s, but excesses in refined products and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will more than pick up the slack.

In fact, they already are. From the peak in 2011 to 2017, the country's trade deficit in energy products fell 83%. The pace of the trend is why, given the right combination of factors, the U.S. Energy Information Administration thinks the country could become a net energy exporter as soon as 2020. It's not as big of a reach as it seems.

While higher energy prices can juice the import and export numbers from year to year, it washes out when considering the trade balance for each annual period. A combination of booming domestic production fulfilling a greater proportion of consumption and soaring exports from brand-new LNG export terminals and the lifting of the ban on crude oil exports in December 2015 puts the United States on a path to becoming a net energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s. A number of companies are doing their part to make sure it happens.

These stocks are poised to capitalize

Energy companies up and down the value chain stand to make an impact. It turns out that looking at the structure of the industry is a great way to survey the opportunities available. Here's an example of a company or two from each major category driving the American energy trade trend.

Crude oil production : In April 2018, oil exports from Texas exceeded imports for the first time ever. The Texas Gulf Coast is responsible for nearly 75% of the country's oil exports, which recently hit a record of 2 million barrels per day. Some estimates suggest total crude oil exports could hit 5 million barrels per day by the end of 2023.

Sending more oil abroad makes room for more oil production here at home. EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) is an independent energy producer that has maintained extraordinary fiscal discipline for its production assets over the years. The company focuses on returns, not production volumes, to gauge its success. By that measuring stick, it's been wildly successful.

In the first six months of 2018, the business delivered year-over-year increases of 52% for revenue and 682% for operating income. That's because EOG Resources can remain profitable with crude oil above $50 per barrel, so it shouldn't be surprising that it's absolutely crushing it with oil prices near $70 per barrel now.

Household names are making a splash, too. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has plans to double earnings and cash flow by 2025, in large part driven by a fivefold increase in crude oil and natural gas production in the Permian Basin. It already has begun financing massive new energy pipelines out of the region and toward its robust refinery infrastructure along the Texas Gulf Coast, which likely means the oil major will play a significant role in increasing energy exports from the United States.

U.S. Crude Oil Exports (4-Week Average) data by YCharts.

Midstream : Pipeline operators represent a critical link in the industry's value chain. They're responsible for gathering crude oil and natural gas production from the field, moving it to processing facilities, then to chemical manufacturing, refinery, or export infrastructure.

Antero Midstream Partners (NYSE: AM) is uniquely positioned to capitalize on natural gas production in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins, which are responsible for 41% of the country's total shale gas output. The region is expected to double production by 2023 -- and the company will be ready .

After building out gas gathering and processing (and freshwater-delivery) infrastructure to support its sponsor, Antero Resources , the business has grown distributable cash flow 1,032% since its IPO in 2014. It expects for that to continue after investing $2.7 billion in growth projects in the next five years, which could allow it to grow its distribution per unit from $1.66 today to $4.10 by 2022.

Meanwhile, $68 billion behemoth Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is investing to exploit the under-the-radar opportunity represented by natural gas liquids (NGL) and chemical manufacturing. Since 2010, a staggering $181 billion has been committed to building new petrochemical manufacturing infrastructure in the United States -- all because of cheap NGLs that can be used as feedstocks. The resulting chemical production then will be used domestically, or more likely, it will be exported.

Enterprise Products Partners has or is building pipelines to deliver NGLs to chemical manufacturing infrastructure or export terminals to go along with storage, transport, and export infrastructure for the resulting petrochemicals. In other words, the company will play a huge role in exports of both NGLs and petrochemicals (for which the United States posted a trade deficit of $40 billion in 2017).

LNG exports : According to estimates compiled by Kinder Morgan , the United States is expected to increase exports of LNG from 2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2017 to 14 Bcf/d in 2027 -- representing 38% of the country's total required production increase in that span. Investors won't have to wait that long, though. By 2020, the United States will become the third-largest exporter of LNG behind only Qatar and Australia.

The undisputed king of LNG exports today is Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT: LNG) , the owner of the Sabine Pass facility, which, until recently, represented nearly all of the country's export capacity. When the Corpus Christi facility comes online by the end of 2019, the company will own close to 4.5 Bcf/d of export capacity. But by then, it won't be the only exporter cashing in.

Kinder Morgan will have a relatively small export capacity volume at its Elba Island project. Dominion Energy recently started up the Cove Point project. Throw in the first legs of the Cameron and Freeport projects, and the United States could have over 9 Bcf/d of export capacity entering 2020.

American energy dominance is here to stay

Despite being over a decade old now, the shale energy revolution has continued to pay tremendous dividends for oil and gas producers and the nation, as a whole. Things will get better still. With the United States expected to become a net energy exporter by 2022 (or sooner) and continue growing exports for the foreseeable future, this is one energy trend individual investors with a long-term mindset can't afford to pass up.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-investing-in-oil-cm1013063,"The global oil market is gargantuan in size. Each day, the oil industry pumps more than 98 million barrels of crude out of the ground. With the price of a barrel currently around $70, it puts the value of global oil trade at a stunning $2.5 trillion per year. For perspective, that's bigger than all the raw metal markets combined, and is more than 10 times the size of the gold market . Given the size and importance of the oil market to the global economy, it's one that investors need to understand.

That's easier said than done considering the oil market's volatility and complexity, which can cause investors to lose money very quickly. It also doesn't help that investors have myriad options to choose from including oil futures contracts , mutual funds , exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , as well as oil and gas stocks . To make the oil market easier to understand, we'll break it down into bite-sized pieces.

A brief history on the oil industry

People have been using oil for more than 4,000 years. Asphalt, which is a thick, sticky form of oil, was used to build the walls and towers of ancient Babylon (modern-day Iraq). Meanwhile, the Persians (modern-day Iran) used petroleum for lighting and medicinal purposes. The Chinese have also been using oil for thousands of years and drilled the earliest-known wells nearly 2,000 years ago using bamboo poles to tap shallow oil reservoirs about 800 feet below the surface.

The modern oil industry got its start in 1859 when Edwin Drake completed the first commercially drilled oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, using a steam engine. While others drilled wells before Drake, his ignited a drilling boom, driven by demand for kerosene and oil lamps. Demand for oil continued growing as people discovered more uses, and has escalated since the internal combustion engine came on the scene.

In 2018, analysts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) expect global oil demand to average 99.2 million barrels per day. The United States will consume about 20% of that oil, using 70% as a transportation fuel. Meanwhile, industrial uses such as petrochemicals and plastics will account for another 24% of U.S. oil demand while residential and commercial usage such as heating should consume roughly 5% and the final 1% will be used to generate electricity. Those percentages differ by country, though the bulk of the world's oil -- 58% -- gets refined into transportation fuels.

Oil market fundamentals: Understanding supply and demand

The relationship between oil supply and global demand plays a significant role in the oil market and is a crucial factor driving the price of a barrel of oil. When supplies match demand, oil prices typically stay above production costs so that producers can make a profit. However, when market fundamentals are no longer in balance, it can have a significant impact on pricing.

In 2016, for example, oil producers around the globe produced an average of 95.8 million BPD, which was more than the market needed since demand averaged of 95.4 million BPD. Because supplies outpaced demand, crude piled up in storage facilities around the world, which put downward pressure on oil prices in 2016 causing them to fall below $30 a barrel. That level was below the breakeven point for many oil producers, which began losing money, putting significant pressure on their stock prices.

In 2018, on the other hand, global oil production has averaged about 98 million BPD, which is currently below demand of around 99.1 million BPD because members of OPEC as well as some other major producing counties are holding back supplies to help drain off the inventory buildup from a few years ago. Consequently, crude prices have recovered well into the $70s, which is enabling many oil companies to produce large profits, causing their stock prices to rebound.

While several factors can impact oil supplies, a crucial one is that oil wells steadily deplete. As a result, the industry needs to drill new ones just to offset this lost production and even more to meet demand. That makes oil production very capital-intensive, which means companies need to continually invest money to both sustain and grow production to meet rising global demand. When times are good, oil producers have enough money to increase production faster. However, if they expand output too quickly, it can cause supply to outpace demand, which puts downward pressure on prices. Other issues can also impact supplies such as geopolitical turmoil, natural disasters, equipment outages, and OPEC. Meanwhile, demand can ebb and flow with the global economy. A red-hot economy can spur faster-paced demand growth, while high oil prices can cool both off

The key factor for investors to understand is that the oil industry thrives when supplies roughly match demand. That keeps crude prices high enough so that producers can generate sufficient profitability to invest in the wells needed to offset the decline from legacy wells. On top of that, they need to drill new ones to meet steadily growing demand.

Oil market fundamentals: Understanding oil prices

Oil has many prices depending on the location and type. The most well-known oil price is Brent, which is crude produced out of the North Sea and serves as a major global benchmark. Another important oil price is West Texas Intermediate, WTI, which as the name suggests, is oil produced in Western Texas. Other common varieties of crude are Western Canadian Select (WCS) from Canada's oil sands region and the OPEC Reference Basket, which is a blend of several types of oil produced by OPEC countries.

Oil trades at different prices due to refinability as well as regional issues. Earlier in 2018, WCS sold for $25 less than a barrel of WTI because of pipeline problems and the fact that this heavier blend was harder to refine. In the meantime, WTI has traded as much as $10 below Brent in recent years because there isn't enough infrastructure to get U.S. oil to global markets. Because oil prices can differ significantly, oil producers in some regions make less money than others. That difference is something investors need to keep in mind if they invest directly in the stock of an oil producer.

How OPEC impacts oil investors

No discussion on the oil market would be complete without mentioning OPEC , which is an intergovernmental organization currently made up of 14 oil-producing nations that work together to coordinate and unify their oil policies. Those counties combine to produce about 40% of global oil supplies, which gives OPEC lots of sway over the oil market. The organization has used this power countless times over its nearly 60-year history.

In late 2014, for example, OPEC chose not to intervene in an oil market that was quickly becoming oversupplied due to rapidly rising output from the U.S. as a result of an uptick in shale drilling . Instead, it wanted to maintain its roughly 40% share of the global oil market by letting prices fall and forcing higher-cost producers to cut back on new wells. More recently, however, OPEC has turned its focus back on supporting a more balanced oil market by working with several nonmember nations including Russia in a coordinated effort to cap production below demand so that the market could burn off some of the excess supply sitting in storage. That agreement has helped significantly lift the price of oil over the past year.

A crucial understanding for investors is that OPEC controls a meaningful portion of global oil production. That makes it a force in the oil market, which is why investors need to keep an eye on its movements since they can impact oil stock prices.

Ways to invest in the oil market

Like many other commodities , there are several ways to invest in the oil market. While it's possible to buy a barrel of oil just like an investor can buy a bar of gold or a piece of jewelry, that's not the most practical option. Because of that, most investors who want direct exposure to the price of oil will buy futures contracts or an ETF that invests in oil futures like United States Oil (NYSEMKT: USO) , which buys futures on WTI. However, due to trading costs and other issues like contango and backwardation -- the former being the cost of storage and insurance while the latter has to do with future pricing concerns -- the U.S. Oil ETF has dramatically underperformed the price of oil over the long term.

USO data by YCharts .

Thus, investors should only consider using the United States Oil ETF if they strongly believe the price of oil will move sharply in the near term.

Investors also have the option of buying ETFs and mutual funds that own oil-related stocks as well as the stocks of individual companies. Before an investor goes in that direction, though, it's important that they know more about how companies fit in the oil market value chain, which is a group of linked companies working together to meet the needs of a market. In the oil industry, there are three main links in the chain: upstream, midstream, and downstream.

What is the upstream oil and gas industry?

Oil drilling techniques have changed dramatically over the years. While people dug the first oil wells by hand with bamboo poles, today the industry uses ultra-modern rigs that can quickly drill miles down into the ground, turn the wellbore 90 degrees, and then drill several more miles horizontally to land a well precisely in the most oil-rich spot within a rock formation. This drilling process is part of the upstream segment of the oil industry that consists of oil production companies that operate the wells and a myriad of oil-field service and equipment companies that help take them from concept to production.

Oil production companies come in all sizes, from a small ""mom-and-pop"" producer with just a handful of wells to a state-owned behemoth like Saudi Aramco, which is the national oil company of Saudi Arabia and the largest oil producer in the world at 10.2 million BPD, or more than 10% of the global total. However, for investors, oil companies can be broken down into two main categories: independent exploration and production (E&P) companies and integrated oil companies . The difference is that E&Ps mainly operate upstream (and therefore make their money by producing oil) while integrated companies also participate in the midstream and downstream sectors (providing greater diversification and exposure to more of the oil industry's value chain).

ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is the largest independent E&P in the world after it spun off its midstream and downstream assets into Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) in 2012. In 2017, ConocoPhillips produced 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day from 17 different countries. Since ConocoPhillips makes most of its money producing oil, investors who buy its stock have direct exposure to the price of crude. In other words, when oil prices go up, ConocoPhillips' profits and stock price should follow.

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , meanwhile, is the largest publicly traded integrated oil company in the world. Not only is it a large oil producer at roughly 4 million BOE per day, but it's a major refiner and petrochemical producer. Those latter two activities consume oil, which helps offset some of the volatility that oil price fluctuations can have on profits. So, ExxonMobil tends to generate steadier earnings and cash flow, making it a less risky investment option than most E&Ps.

Oil producers rely on a variety of outside service companies to assist them in all aspects of exploration and production. Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) is the world's largest oil-field service company and provides a compressive suite of products and services to help E&P companies find, drill, and produce oil. Many smaller service companies focus on niche markets such as owning and operating the drilling rigs or supplying the materials or equipment needed to drill and produce oil. Overall, the global oil-field service industry pulls in more than $100 billion in revenue each year by providing support to oil producers, giving investors a wide variety of opportunities to invest in the production of oil without buying the stock of an oil producer.

What is the midstream industry?

Once an oil well comes on line, the production needs to get to end markets. But it's not as simple as hooking the well up to a pipeline and calling it a day. There's a complex value chain of midstream assets needed to maximize the value of every barrel of crude that comes out of the ground.

This process starts with gathering pipelines, which transports a well's production to central processing locations that separate oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and water. The oil then moves by truck, pipeline, or tanker to storage facilities while it waits to go through a refinery or petrochemical complex and get turned into fuel, chemicals, or another oil-based product. While oil companies tend to own some of these midstream assets, especially gathering lines and processing facilities, third parties hold a significant portion of the energy infrastructure in North America. These companies often charge fees for the logistical services provided to oil companies. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) are a noteworthy owner of these assets in the U.S. and most commonly found in the energy midstream sector. MLPs are tax-advantaged entities that pass through most of their income to investors. The largest MLP by enterprise value is Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) , while other notable ones include Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE: MMP) and MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) .

Because midstream companies charge fees for their services, they tend to have limited direct exposure to commodity prices and therefore generate more stable cash flow compared to companies in the upstream sector. That often makes them better options for investors who want some exposure to the oil market but with less volatility. Another benefit of midstream companies, especially MLPs, is that they tend to pay high-yielding dividends . For example, Enterprise Products Partners, MPLX, and Magellan Midstream Partners all yield more than 5%.

What is the downstream industry?

The final leg of oil's journey from a reservoir to an end-user is the downstream sector. This segment of the oil industry transforms raw oil into refined petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, heating oil as well as other products like lubricants, waxes, and petrochemicals. In addition to the refineries and petrochemical plants, the downstream industry also consists of marketing and distribution assets such as tanker trucks and gas stations.

Like the other segments of the oil industry, investors have several options to choose from in the downstream sector, which typically makes more money when oil prices are low because they need to buy oil, which they then refine into higher-value products like gasoline. A company like Phillips 66 operates refineries, petrochemical plants, as well as marketing and distribution businesses. Meanwhile, other companies focus solely on one area of the downstream segment. For example, PBF Energy (NYSE: PBF) mainly operates refineries, Westlake Chemical (NYSE: WLK) primarily owns petrochemical plants, while Sunoco LP (NYSE: SUN) distributes refined products to places like gas stations.

The basket approach: An easy way to invest in oil

Investors have a multitude of oil stocks to choose from if they want to add some oil market exposure to their portfolio. They can go with an integrated oil giant like ExxonMobil and gain access to nearly the entire oil market value chain in one stock. They could also buy a couple of oil-related stocks across the value chain and make their own integrated mini-portfolio or target specific companies or subsectors of the industry. Each option requires a lot of research and has risks and reward potential. That's why investors just starting out on their journey to invest in the oil market might want to consider gaining that exposure through an oil-focused mutual fund or an oil ETF .

While there are several options available, one of the top ones is the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE) . This ETF offers broad exposure to more than 140 oil stocks, though it's heavily weighted to the 10 largest oil stocks, which make up nearly 65% of the total value of its holdings. That focus on the largest oil companies across the entire value chain makes the Vanguard Energy ETF a less risky option compared to ETFs or mutual funds more heavily weighted toward E&P companies. Another benefit of the Vanguard Energy ETF is that its expense ratio is 93% less than the average of funds with similar holdings. That makes it a low-cost and lower-risk way for an investor to add some oil market exposure to their portfolio.

Wrapping up the oil market

The oil market is a complex beast that's crucial to the global economy. Because of that, oil companies invest billions of dollars each year to keep up with demand, pumping crude through their assets as it flows downstream and is transformed into useful products. That leaves investors with a nearly limitless opportunity set to potentially make money from each step of this process. While there are risks, the rewards of investing in oil can be even greater .

Crude prices climbed for the first time in four weeks as inventories tightened more than analysts expected and on anticipation of lower exports from Iran, the third largest oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, ahead of U.S. sanctions against Tehran coming fully into effect from Nov. 4.

West Texas Intermediate and Brent futures climbed by more than 1% intraday after the number of oil rigs operating in the US dropped by nine to 860, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes ( BHGE ), which tracked the seven-day period ending Aug. 24.

The combined oil and gas rig count in the U.S. slumped by 13 to 1,044, as gas rigs fell by four at 182.

Oil prices were higher mid-week after the Energy Information Administration said in a report Wednesday crude stockpiles slumped by 5.8 million barrels over a week to Aug. 21. That compares with expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop in a Reuters' survey of analysts.

Oil prices have climbed about 4% this week with President Donald Trump looking set to press ahead with the planned imposition of economic sanctions against Tehran, which is refusing to enter any talks with the U.S. on the grounds none of the other signatories to the Iran nuclear accord have agreed with President Trump's proposal to renegotiate the deal.

A report from MarketWatch said Friday sanctions were already leading to lower production from Iran. It cited analysts at Cowen as saying they expect to see a 900,000-barrel to 1.6 million-barrel cut in Iranian exports.

But, those analysts also estimated a pick-up in output from other members of OPEC, most notably Saudi Arabia and Russia. Some market pundits have, however, suggested such a move could be bullish for prices as additional output would stretch both the oil-rich nations, reducing their ability to respond to an unforeseen supply shock.

The market is also monitoring the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China as tariffs could hit global demand which could, in turn, result in lower demand for commodities. A weaker prognosis for the global economy is likely to underpin the safe-haven dollar, and that may be negative news for oil prices , which tend to be inversely correlated with crude.

Ever since the tariff row started between the world's two largest economies, the total amount of goods under the US and Chinese import levies have hit $50 billion. Trade officials from both the nations are currently engaged in talks, but no breakthrough is in sight yet to resolve the tariff dispute, putting pressure on markets.

Meanwhile, in Canada, the number of oil rigs in operation jumped by 12 to 153, with the gas rigs increasing by five to 76, Baker Hughes said. The North American rig count rose by four to 1,273 in the past week and compared with 1,157 a year ago, the data showed.",2018-08-24,

Most of the time, those investments go up in smoke, and that's when having a diversified portfolio pays off.

Every once in a while, though, one of these smaller companies catches fire and generates incredible returns for your portfolio. If you're lucky enough to find one of these stocks and hold on to it for years, you might even get a stock that achieves what we at The Motley Fool have coined a spiffy-pop .

One stock that has caught my attention and made me incredibly bullish is Tellurian (NASDAQ: TELL) . The company is trying to build a next-generation liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the United States. Is it a risky investment? Oh, yeah. Do a lot of things have to swing its way to realize its potential? You betcha. Do I believe that the company could be the millionaire-maker stock in my portfolio? Absolutely. Here's why:

Image source: Getty Images.

Fundamentals are there

It's getting harder and harder to overstate the impact of natural gas from shale in America. Shale drilling has gone from what was once considered a high-cost, marginal source of natural gas requiring a gimmicky extraction method, to the predominant production technique to unlock unprecedented amounts of cheap gas. What's more, with the abundance of this gas and the cheap extraction methods we have developed, U.S. natural gas is priced at a significant discount to gas from other sources around the world. This means there are ample opportunities for companies to export it and generate a profit from the difference in regional prices.

Natural gas, and LNG in particular, is in high demand globally right now because of i ts lower carbon footprint, compared to coal, for power generation. And it is a lower-cost fuel for home heating. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, LNG demand is expected to grow by 72% between now and 2030, making it the fastest growing fossil fuel by a wide margin.

Companies exporting LNG are right in the middle of a cheap, ample supply of gas looking for a market, and fast-growing global demand. It is why the country's first LNG terminal, Cheniere Energy 's (NYSEMKT: LNG) Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana, has exceeded expectations thus far and is even defying conventional wisdom in the LNG market.

Tellurian is looking to capture its own piece of this market with its proposed Driftwood LNG export terminal. The facility would be able to export 27.6 million tons of LNG annually, and Tellurian is looking to supply that terminal with its own pipelines and its own production.

Why Tellurian is unique

Tellurian isn't the only company looking to get into the LNG export game. Cheniere Energy already has a fully operational facility and is looking to expand, and big-name companies like ExxonMobil have proposed facilities for the Gulf Coast. Also, Tellurian is nothing more than a business plan right now. So there is a lot of risk for this small company going up against industry titans. Despite these challenges, here's why I think Tellurian has what it takes to succeed:

This isn't management's first rodeo: One of the things that is compelling about Tellurian's chances of bringing this plan to fruition is that most of its management has already done so somewhere else. It's founder and chairman, Charif Souki, was the founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy before Carl Icahn forced him out. Current Tellurian CEO Meg Gentle was one of Souki's top lieutenants at Cheniere and held a variety of roles, including EVP of marketing and CFO. Six of the company's officers and vice presidents are Cheniere alumni, and the company also plucked a lot of talent from BG Group's LNG business after Royal Dutch Shell bought them out. There aren't many people out there who have the experience starting a business from scratch that this crew has.

Six of the company's officers and vice presidents are Cheniere alumni, and the company also plucked a lot of talent from BG Group's LNG business after bought them out. There aren't many people out there who have the experience starting a business from scratch that this crew has. Everyone has some skin in the game: It's always encouraging when a company's founders and executives own a considerable share of the company. That is certainly the case here, as founders and employees own 43% of shares outstanding. Even more interesting, though, is that some big-name companies have taken equity stakes as well. French oil giant Total has a 19% stake in the company and will undoubtedly be looking to use Tellurian to move its shale gas production overseas. Also, the company slated to build the facility, Bechtel, and the supplier of the LNG liquefaction equipment, General Electric , have taken equity stakes. So not only does management have a stake in the company's success, so do its vendors and contractors.

Also, the company slated to build the facility, Bechtel, and the supplier of the LNG liquefaction equipment, , have taken equity stakes. So not only does management have a stake in the company's success, so do its vendors and contractors. A compelling business model: Building an LNG facility takes a lot of money, and a company without existing operations and cash flow to fund development needs to raise a lot of cash. Cheniere relied on lots of debt, private equity, and some creative financial moves. It wasn't ideal, but it got the job done. What Tellurian is looking to do instead is bring in partners for the project that will have part ownership of Driftwood LNG. For an up-front payment of $1,500 per ton of production capacity, companies can buy a stake in Driftwood that will give them the right to buy LNG at cost. Tellurian plans to sell 58% of the facility under this arrangement, which would leave Tellurian with 11.6 million tons of annual LNG production. The bright side for Tellurian: It will need only $3.5 billion in debt to complete it. Just for reference, Cheniere has taken on $26.9 billion in debt for its two facilities.

Image source: Getty Images.

If management can pull this off as its current investor presentations project, Tellurian would be sitting on a facility that will produce $2 billion in annual free cash flow. That's assuming the average Gulf Coast netback price for LNG -- the market price for LNG where its sold minus the transportation cost to ship it there -- is $6 per million BTU. Currently, it's $8.85 per million BTU, so there are even upside opportunities in those assumptions.

What's next?

So a lot of things must fall into place for Tellurian to make this happen. It needs to get equity partners to buy a stake in Driftwood LNG at the set price; it needs to obtain all the necessary permits, including the all-important permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to export to non-free-trade-agreement countries, and it needs to build the terminal on time and on budget.

Tellurian has already completed two crucial steps. It has negotiated a guaranteed lump-sum contract with Bechtel (making Bechtel responsible for cost overruns). And it has conducted an open season for its two gas pipelines, both of which were oversubscribed -- which means that producers requested more space in the pipelines than what will be available. While these two things are no guarantee that this project will happen, they certainly help show its viability.

Many of the things that need to happen before Tellurian breaks ground will likely occur in the next six months. It has been actively marketing Driftwood to potential partners since February and expects to announce the winning bids either this or next quarter. Then, FERC says it will be issuing permit notices in January of 2019. So we could get several answers about Tellurian's future very soon.

Millionaire maker?

I can't guarantee anyone that they will be instant millionaires with this stock, but it sure does look like there is a lot of potential to realize some huge gains if things happen according to management's plan. Today, the company has a market capitalization of just under $2 billion. Gauging by estimated cash flows from this facility, the stock trades for about 1 times free cash flow once the facility is fully operational.

It might be a leap of faith to assume that things go according to plan, and any investor in Tellurian has to realize this could all go belly up if it doesn't get enough customers or obtain all the necessary permits. But for a company to be irrationally optimistic about, Tellurian looks like a good candidate.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/imo-2020-to-alter-global-fuel-economics-will-refiners-gain-cm1012726,"As the whole world is striving to achieve a cleaner energy environment, taking measures to curb pollution has become an important objective for authorities. In this regard, International Maritime Organization (IMO) intends to lower the sulfur content in marine fuels to reduce pollution from marine vessels, which has increased lately, especially due to a rise in the number of shipping vessels on water. In 2016, the IMO announced its decision to curb sulfur amount in marine fuels to 0.5% from the current cap of 3.5% by 2020. IMO believes this move to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Significant Effect on the Demand Side

Notably, 5% of the world oil demand comes from the shipping industry, which is around 5 million barrels a day. Most cargo ships and tankers currently use oil with a high sulfur content, which is considered a dirty fuel. Once the rule is implemented, the shipping industry will have three options to choose from:

Switching to fuels with lower-sulfur content (low sulfur fuel oil or LSFO), which are costlier than dirty fuels Using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative for dirty fuels after costly infrastructural changes Installing costly scrubbers in the ship to cleanse sulfur from dirty fuels

The last two options require an immediate lumpsum cost to be incurred by the shippers, while the first option provides more time to adapt. Per the Wall Street Journal, the new rule will cost the maritime industry around $40 billion.

In a survey of ship owners conducted by Drewry, it was observed that 66% of the ship owners planned to use LSFO, 13% were likely to opt for scrubbers and 8% will use LNG. The survey result confirms that the shipping industry is going to witness strong demand for LSFO.

Supply-Side View

IMO 2020 is expected to have a direct effect on the global refining sector, something which investors are wary of. The new rule is expected to bring in a sea change at refineries in terms of their operations and configurations. While simple refineries are expected to suffer initially from the change, complex and larger refineries can reap profits from the decision.

Simple refineries with less sophisticated technologies process crude into different parts, of which dirty residual fuel oil is used on vessels. Following IMO 2020, demand for their product will decline. The simple refineries will require change in technology and production process to adapt to the new rule and it will cost both money and time. It's to be noted that these refineries have roughly 16 months to change their operations and configurations.

Large complex refineries that have already started the process of changing configurations, around the globe, will witness significantly high demand for their fuels following IMO 2020. Notably, there are clusters of refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Europe as well as in parts of Asia, who possess the characteristics required to make profit from the new ruling.

Companies With Large Complex Refineries

Some energy companies like BP plc BP are already producing low-sulfur products. High sulfur fuel oil only comprises 3% of BP's total fuel production. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Energy behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM , TOTAL SA TOT , Royal Dutch Shell plc RDS.A and others are already either producing low-sulfur fuel or on track to upgrade their refineries. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

Needless to say, IMO 2020 is going to be the next big thing in the energy industry. Not only will it reduce pollution, it will also change the fuel demand pattern of the shipping industry. Inevitably, the change in supply pattern is expected to be demand driven. All the ill-equipped refineries are likely to witness plunging demand for their high-sulfur fuels, while the complex refineries are poised to witness high demand for their low-sulfur fuel products. The low-sulfur products will also have a higher price level. With more shippers expected to opt for LSFO, it looks like a huge opportunity for complex refineries to rake in profits.

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund should continue to invest in oil and gas companies, a government-appointed commission recommended on Friday, contradicting earlier advice from the central bank, and boosting the shares of oil firms.

A decision on whether to drop energy shares from the fund's benchmark index, and thus divest tens of billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks over time, is expected this autumn.

On Friday shares of European oil firms, including Shell and BP, rose on the news of the commission's advice.

""To get that small insurance (against the fluctuation of the oil price by removing energy stocks), it would cost the fund a lot, as it would be less diversified,"" commission chair Oeystein Thoegersen told Reuters.

""Second, you would change an institution that has worked very well. And third, as the years go by, we have less and less oil risk,"" he said, referring to Norway's declining oil reserves.

The fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.

Energy stocks amounted to about 4 percent of the value of the fund, or about 315 billion crowns ($37 billion), at the end of 2017, the commission said.

Finance Minister Siv Jensen, who will present the government's decision this autumn, did not signal on Friday which way a decision would go. ""I look forward to reading the assessment,"" she said in a statement.

The fund is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2017 of 2.19 percent in Shell, 2.17 percent of BP, 0.94 percent of Chevron and 0.87 percent of Exxon Mobil.

The fund also held 1.42 percent of Eni, 1.79 percent of Total and 0.22 percent of Lundin Petroleum, among others.

""We have given our advice and we are now awaiting the government's decision,"" deputy central bank governor Egil Matsen said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

In a scenario with sustained lower oil prices, the reduction of the government's net cash flow from petroleum activities would be substantial, according to the commission.

A sale of energy stocks would also challenge the investment strategy of the fund, with broad diversification of investments and a high threshold for exclusion, it added.

""Should the owner seek any additional reduction in oil price risk, it is likely to be more effective to reduce the Norwegian state's direct ownership in Equinor or the state's Direct Financial Interest (state-owned oil firm Petoro),"" the commission said.

The Norwegian state owns 67 percent of Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, and 100 percent of Petoro. Successive Norwegian governments have ruled out reducing the state's stakes in those companies.

Some observers of the fund did not welcome the commission's findings.

""This recommendation will prove to be a failure and the Norwegian Government will be forced to change this as fossil fuel investments continue to drag down global investment indexes and the Norwegian economy,"" Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance for US energy finance think-tank, IEEFA, told Reuters.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-oil-prices-rise-as-eia-confirms-large-inventory-draw-cm1011986,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 3.1% (or $2.02) to end at $67.86 per barrel yesterday - the highest settlement since Aug 7.

Energy Stocks on a Roll

The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR - an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies - up 1.2% Wednesday.

The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil XOM and Chevron CVX gained 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest movers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Marathon Oil Corporation MRO , Hess Corporation HES , Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. DO and Newfield Exploration Company NFX .

Analysis of the EIA Data

Crude Oil: The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels for the week ending Aug 17, following a shock increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts - the leading independent commodities and energy data provider - had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.4 million barrels.

Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 48 of the last 72 weeks and are down nearly 55 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 408.4 million barrels, current crude supplies are 12% below the year-ago figure though stocks are at the five-year average.

Strong refiner demand and lower imports led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose back to 11 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.

In particular, output in the United States have climbed sharply on increased production from shale formations to remain over the 10 million barrels a day threshold since early February.

Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma - the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange - rose 772,000 barrels to 24.2 million barrels.

The crude supply cover was down from 23.6 days in the previous week to 23 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 26.5 days.

Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the second time in three weeks on slightly weaker demand. The 1.2 million barrels gain - defying the polled number of 400,000 barrels fall in supply level - took gasoline stockpiles up to 234.3 million barrels. Following last week's addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 1.9% above the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.

Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were up 1.8 million barrels last week. Meanwhile, analysts expected the supply level to increase by 2 million barrels. The fourth weekly rise in a row could be attributed to an uptick in production. Nevertheless, at 130.8 million barrels, current supplies are 12% below the year-ago level and 7% lower than the five-year average.

Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was unchanged from the prior week at 98.1% - the highest in 20 years.

About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.

The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.

Australia's Santos revives dividend, shares soar on Quadrant acquisition



By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Santos Ltd, Australia's second-largest independent gas producer, reported on Thursday a near doubling in first-half underlying profit and revived its dividend after slashing debt.

The turnaround came a day after Santos agreed to buy Quadrant Energy for at least $2.15 billion, expanding in Western Australia and grabbing a potentially big new oil find just three months after rejecting a $10.8 billion takeover offer from private equity-backed Harbour Energy.

""On a very preliminary basis, the acquisition price looks good to us,"" Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts said in a note.

Underlying profit for the half-year ended June 30 rose to $217 million from $109 million a year earlier, beating an RBC forecast of $189 million, even after first half output was hit by an outage at the Papua New Guinea LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant after an earthquake.

Santos declared an interim dividend of $0.035 a share.

It suspended dividends in 2016, diverting cash to pay down debt which peaked for the construction of its Gladstone LNG project just as oil prices collapsed.

""We will shortly achieve our net debt reduction target, more than a year ahead of schedule, and therefore have a significantly stronger balance sheet to support our growth strategy,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher said in a statement.

Santos cut net debt to $2.44 billion in the first half, and said it was on course to reduce net debt to below $2 billion before the end of 2018, thanks to sharp cost-cutting and a rebound in oil and gas prices.

The company said it still expected 2018 production of 55-58 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) on growing output from its Cooper Basin assets, and maintained its sales volume guidance of 72-76 mmboe.

The Quadrant acquisition is expected to boost Santos' free cash flow by around 17 percent in 2019, assuming oil prices of $65 a barrel.

Santos said the cash generated from Quadrant, the biggest gas supplier to the domestic market in Western Australia, will help fund expansions in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea and service the $1.2 billion in debt it is taking on for the deal.

Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic questioned whether the deal was designed to shield Santos from another takeover bid.

""We are comfortable with the value achieved for the price paid here, but are left wondering if this really ultimately adds anything material other than scale and debt for Santos and makes Santos less attractive as a takeover target to an LNG focused player,"" Kavonic said.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/how-to-yieldboost-exxon-mobil-corp-to-71-using-options-cm1011471,"Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 4.1% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2020 covered call at the $87.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.35 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 7.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $87.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XOM shares would have to advance 9.6% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 13.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Exxon Mobil Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for XOM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 4.1% annualized dividend yield.

Below is a chart showing XOM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $87.50 strike highlighted in red:

The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 covered call at the $87.50 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $87.50. ( Do most options expire worthless? This and six other common options myths debunked ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Exxon Mobil Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $79.75) to be 18%.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-top-oil-stocks-to-buy-in-august-cm1011202,"The oil and gas industry has been a strange market lately. Even though the price of oil is up close to 40% over the past year, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLE) , which is comprised largely of oil and gas companies, is up just 17%. While a 17% return is impressive in its own right, it is still well below the gains of crude oil. While it's not a surefire sign that the industry is undervalued, it does suggest that those willing to sift through the industry could find some deals as oil hovers around $70 a barrel.

So we asked three of our Motley Fool contributors to each highlight a stock they see as a buy in the oil and gas industry right now. Here's why they picked ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) , and Phillps 66 Partners (NYSE: PSXP) .

XLE price change. Data source: YCharts.

Don't overlook the long-term potential

Tyler Crowe (ExxonMobil): ExxonMobil has historically been one of the best in the oil business thanks to incredibly disciplined capital allocation. For decades, the market has assigned the company a premium to its peers because it has consistently produced higher rates of return. Recently, though, the company made a few decisions that have made investors question Exxon's reputation. Its 2010 acquisition of XTO Energy was probably an overpay for mostly shale gas assets and its involvement in extremely expensive projects like Kashagan in Kazakhstan and Gorgon LNG in Australia have lowered return rates.

Even though the company has had a few missteps lately and its production rates tumbled as it scales back from these expensive endeavors, management's current plan shows a clear way forward . It has a suite of high-value projects set to go live between 2020 and 2025 that will add 1 million barrels per day of production and more than double its earnings by 2025, even if oil remains around $60 per barrel.

Wall Street isn't that patient, though, and Exxon's stock is trading at its lowest valuation in decades. For those that can wait for management to implement this plan and suffer through what will likely be a series of underwhelming quarterly reports, now looks like a great time to buy shares of ExxonMobil.

One of the best

Matt DiLallo (EOG Resources): Shale giant EOG Resources proved once again why it's one of the best in the business during the second quarter. Not only did the oil producer continue to post strong production and earnings results but it unveiled three pleasant surprises . That's after the company provided investors with another big-time dividend increase as well as announcing that it made two new oil finds in the Powder River Basin while boosting its estimated recoverable resources from that play by tenfold.

On the on hand, even with EOG's 19% dividend raise in the second quarter, the company still offers a paltry payout of less than 1%. However, it plans to deliver high-octane dividend growth in the coming years , which alone could fuel market-beating returns since dividend growth stocks have historically outperformed their stingier peers. Meanwhile, the discovery of two new high-return growth engines, which helped fuel a massive increase in its resource potential from that play, gives EOG Resources more fuel to continue growing production and earnings at a fast pace in the coming years.

EOG Resources' focus on exploration-driven growth has been wildly successful over the years. In the last decade, shares are up more than 160%, which has outpaced the 130% return of the S&P 500 . What's so impressive about that outperformance is that EOG beat the market even though oil prices have fallen more than 40%. With oil prices now on the upswing, and EOG running a well-oiled drilling machine, I think it can continue outperforming from here, which makes it one of the top oil stocks to consider buying this month.

A cash cow tied to a refining giant

Jason Hall (Phillips 66 Partners): While shares of refining and petrochemicals giant Phillips 66 continue to march higher following its incredible second quarter , its midstream subsidiary and master limited partnership -- or MLP -- may be getting overlooked as a solid source of dependable income. At recent prices, Phillips 66 Partners units pay a dividend yield of 5.2% after a recent increase following a solid second quarter of its own. Amazingly, it has been able to bump the payout higher an incredible 19 consecutive quarters! Since going public in 2013, Phillips 66 Partners has increased its dividend an incredible 386%, better than 30% on a compounded annual rate.

And while it's probably unrealistic to expect that level of dividend growth to continue, there is still a lot of growth in the offing. Phillips 66 is utilizing its MLP not just as a cash flow-generating tool, but also to develop assets to help connect its own refineries to lower-cost crude sources. This should result in more profitable refining for Phillips 66, and stronger cash flows for Phillips 66 partners from these new pipelines.

With the need for a lot more pipelines and storage refineries connecting North American shale to the energy grid, Phillips 66 is in the right place at the right time. With one of North America's biggest refiners backing it, its prospects are even better. If it's dependable income from the oil patch with solid prospects for growth you're after, Phillips 66 Partners is buy-worthy today.

By A. Ananthalakshmi and Emily Chow

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The chemical manufacturing unit of Malaysia's state energy firm Petronas is actively looking to acquire companies to expand its specialty chemical business, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday.

Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd is looking to grow aggressively in specialty chemicals, which are raw materials used to manufacture consumer products such as high-performance tyres and LCD televisions.

""We have already targeted a few. When we acquire, it's not only for technology but also for market penetration,"" Sazali told Reuters in an interview, adding that Petronas Chemicals was looking at companies in Europe, the United States and India.

Sazali also said the acquisition market was competitive as a lot of companies are looking to expand into petrochemicals.

The hunt for acquisitions comes as parent company Petroliam Nasional Bhd, or Petronas, relies more on its downstream business to boost revenue amid analyst estimates that it will produce less oil in the future.

Much of Petronas' capital expenditures in the last few years has been spent on its downstream business, particularly the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor.

RAPID is part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) that includes a 300,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and a petrochemical complex with a production capacity of 7.7 million metric tonnes and an oil storage site.

Companies such as Saudi Aramco, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have all been expanding into petrochemicals in recent years to diversify their businesses from crude oil production.

Last year, Aramco inked a deal to invest $7 billion in RAPID. It later bought a $900 million stake in petrochemical projects in the RAPID complex.

Petronas Chemicals is spearheading the petrochemicals component of RAPID, which is Petronas' largest downstream project with an estimated $27 billion of total investment.

Sazali said Aramco could expand its investment in PIC.

""There is a possibility... Some we offer to them, some they are interested in but subject to the economics of it,"" he said.

The company is conducting joint studies with other potential partners for developing more petrochemical projects in PIC, he said, declining to provide details.",2018-08-21,

Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australia'sOil Search Ltd reported a near 40 percent fall in half-year profit on Tuesday, hurt by lower output and higher costs after an earthquake in Papua New Guinea halted production at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project for six weeks.

Net profit fell to $79.2 million for the six months to June from $129.1 million last year. That still topped an estimate of $67 million by Royal Bank of Canada.

Oil Search is a partner in the PNG LNG project, run by ExxonMobil Corp, where production was halted after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the country's rugged highlands on Feb. 26, triggering landslides and flattening buildings. More than 145 people died.

On Tuesday, it upgraded its 2018 output guidance to 24-26 mmboe, helped by a recovery in the performance of the PNG LNG plant, which resumed production in mid-April.

Total unit production costs for the half year to June 30 came in at $14.04 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), up from $8.52/boe last year, due to weaker output, the company said.

Oil Search declared an interim dividend of $0.02 a share, down from $0.04 a year ago.",2018-08-20,Exxon

Last February, the stock market had a sharp correction from fears of runaway interest rates. Usually a spike in rates causes a crimp on business activity, thereby negatively affecting the corporate P&Ls. In addition to the February market-wide fears, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) stock had its own reasons to fall over 20% from an earnings event.

So the XOM investors woes were worse than the equities in general. Furthermore, the bounce in XOM stock has merely been to recover half of the first quarter 20% correction. The $84-per-share area has been a recent roof and a point of failure.

But there are some positives to take away from this 2018 price action. The February event was sharp and served as a real test of the $72-per-share support band. This most likely shook off all of the weak hands in the stock. Meaning XOM may have shed as much froth as possible, leaving the current prices more solid than they were at $88-per-share in late January.

There is concern that XOM stock hasn't benefited from the rise in oil prices. And that could put it at a disadvantage if oil makes a correction. A saving grace here is that the U.S. dollar has been very strong, so if it eases a bit, it could help prop crude oil up.

So all that said, the XOM stock price may have set a floor for 2018. And therein lies the opportunity today.

Fundamentally, it is not screaming cheap at price-to-earnings ratio of 22. But it's not bloated either, so owning it at a big discount from these lower levels is not going to be a major financial mistake.

Even though I believe that the floor is in for Exxon stock, I have little faith in expecting a rally from here. So today I share an options trade that doesn't need a rally to profit. In fact, even if XOM falls another 10%, I would still retain my maximum gains.

How to Trade XOM Stock Today

Using options allows me to create a buffer zone between current prices and my level of risk. Compare that with risking $78-per-share and needing a rally to profit.

Technically, $72-per-share has been a floor since early 2016. I bet that it would need a new catalyst to revisit the lows of the 2015 correction, which carried it to $68-per-share. For now, I am comfortable having a breakeven point of $69 in the current macroeconomic conditions.

The experts on Wall Street agree. Even though they are mostly advocating a HOLD on XOM stock, it's still trading much lower than their average range.

The Trade: Sell the XOM Jan 2019 $70 naked put and collect $1 to open. Here, I have an 85% theoretical chance that I would retain maximum gains. But if the price falls below my strike, then I own the shares and would suffer losses below $69.

Those who want to mitigate the risk that comes with selling naked puts can sell spreads instead.

The Alternate Trade: Sell the XOM Jan 2019 $70/$67.50 credit put spread, where the risk is limited. If the spread wins, it would deliver 15% in yield.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-exxonmobil-corporation-a-buy-cm1009882,"ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE: XOM) yield is currently around 4%, the highest it's been since the 1990s. The integrated energy giant's price to tangible book value, meanwhile, is the lowest it has been since the 1980s. If you're looking for a good value in the oil and gas sector, Exxon should be on your wish list. Only there's a reason it's so cheap today: The company is lagging peers on key industry metrics. But despite a few negatives, ExxonMobil Corporation is still a buy for long-term income investors. Here's why.

1. Production in reverse

One of the key ways for an oil and natural gas driller to grow is by expanding production over time. When production falls, the business is, effectively, shrinking. That's been a key sore spot for Exxon lately, with production declining in 2016 and 2017. Although the 2.7% drop over those two years may not seem like a huge deal at first, the production declines have continued into 2018 . Exxon's oil and gas business is simply going in the wrong direction and it has investors worried.

Image source: Getty Images.

To make matters worse, there's nothing in the near term to suggest Exxon is going to shift back into growth mode. In fact, during the second-quarter conference call , management noted that it was focusing on the most profitable production options it has, not on the most expedient. Put another way, the company is focusing on long-term profitability, rather than appeasing short-term investors and their desire to see higher production.

That said, Exxon has a plan. With big investments in onshore U.S. oil and gas, offshore oil in Brazil, and natural gas in Mozambique, among others, Exxon is confident that it can reverse the current downward trend. It will take some time for these multiyear projects to be completed. However, the company expects them to make up 50% of its upstream earnings by 2025. With long-term debt at roughly 10% of its capital structure, the company has the financial leeway to get there even if oil prices head south in the interim.

2. Falling in with the pack

Exxon has another big headache today: Its return on invested capital, a measure of how well management puts its shareholders' money to work, has fallen into the middle of its peer group. Large-scale investments that haven't worked out as planned were a big part of this, including paying a premium for U.S. onshore natural gas company XTO Energy just before gas prices began to soften and a more recent foray with Russia's Rosneft that was effectively killed by U.S. sanctions on the country. That's a change from the past when Exxon was routinely at the head of the pack. This was one of the key reasons that Exxon stock had historically been awarded a premium price relative to peers.

Return on Capital Employed (TTM) data by YCharts .

Once again, Exxon has a plan. But, as with production, it's going to take time for that plan to play out. The reason: These two issues are tightly related. Exxon's goal is to get its return-on-capital employed number up from the current 7% or so into the mid-teens. It hopes to get there by focusing on its highest-value projects, including the ones noted above. Part of the process involves Exxon taking more control of its biggest projects, which would allow it to increasingly benefit from its expertise in bringing giant energy investments to fruition. And history suggests that, given enough time, this strategy will lead to improving performance.

3. The rest of the business

While oil and natural gas are huge at Exxon, there's more to the company's business. Notably, its chemicals and refining operations, segments that help balance out the company's revenue and earnings over time, are also key growth areas for the company today.

Exxon is expecting to double earnings in both segments by 2025. Getting there will include expanding its refining business in the U.S. market to take advantage of its onshore production in the country. That should help maximize profitability and, along with a shift toward premium products (such as lubricants), allow Exxon to increase profit margins by 20% by 2025. On the chemicals side, the energy giant is looking to expand capacity by 40% by 2025, with 13 new chemical plants scheduled to be built. Exxon is looking to benefit from location as well with new investments close to advantaged energy sources (U.S. onshore) and near key end markets (Asia). Return on capital employed in these two businesses is already well above the company's average, with continued strength the expectation. Unfortunately, Exxon's growth plans in chemicals and refining are still long-term in nature, with the 2025 goals more than six years away.

If you don't mind waiting

Is ExxonMobil a buy? There are really two answers to the question. If you are a short-term investor who wants quick results, then the answer is no . Exxon is looking to the long term today and is going to use the same conservative, slow-moving approach it has always taken . If you are a long-term income investor, however, collecting the stock's 4% yield while you wait for Exxon to execute on its growth plans sounds like a pretty good deal. And, assuming things work out as management hopes, investors will likely reward the shares with a premium again in the not-too-distant future as Exxon regains its leadership role in the energy industry. This is why Exxon is in my portfolio today.

By Marianna Parraga and Nivedita Bhattacharjee

Aug 20 (Reuters) - U.S. producer ConocoPhillips and Venezuela's PDVSA have reached a payment agreement over a $2 billion arbitration, the companies said on Monday, suspending a dispute that blocked the state-run company from exporting oil from most of its key Caribbean facilities.

The case relates to the nationalization of Conoco assets dating back over a decade in Venezuela. An international court ruled in favor of Conoco in April and ordered PDVSA to pay. But no payment has been forthcoming, leading Conoco to seize most of PDVSA's Caribbean assets as it sought to enforce its claim.

PDVSA confirmed the agreement in a statement, adding that the deal ""once again shows PDVSA's firm will to reach commercial solutions with its creditors.""

The state oil company has also made progress on similar payment agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp and NuStar Energy LP, the two confirmed.

Venezuela's crude production, a major source of revenue, has fallen to a six-decade low this year as lack of investment, recession and hyperinflation have pushed the OPEC-member country's economy to near collapse.

The settlement could restore a portion of lost exports by resuming shipping from the Caribbean.

ARBITRATION CASES

Conoco asked the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to solve a dispute on the early termination of contracts with PDVSA. The ICC ruled in favor of Conoco in April.

Separately, Conoco brought a claim against Venezuela before a World Bank court over the nationalization of two oil projects. A final ruling on that case before the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is possible by year end, Conoco has said.

""Having missed payments to bondholders in recent months, PDVSA could have built a cushion for paying Conoco,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin American energy researcher at Rice University's Baker Institute.

""PDVSA will have a break, recovering export capacity in the Caribbean, as long as it continues paying Conoco on time. Conoco could focus now on the wider case, before ICSID,"" he added.

Court hearings scheduled for next month in Bonaire and Aruba could have enabled Conoco to begin selling PDVSA assets seized through court attachments. It was unclear if they would go ahead.

In Curacao, where efforts are underway to replace PDVSA as operator of the island's 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery, the agreement was welcomed by the government, which would now have more options to keep the facility working.

SPLIT PAYMENT

PDVSA agreed to make an initial payment of around $500 million within 90 days of signing the agreement. The remainder is to be paid quarterly over a period of 4-1/2 years, Conoco said in a statement.

Under a new military-led management appointed late last year, PDVSA increasingly has struggled to produce, refine and export crude oil amid a severe lack of cash, and faced sanctions imposed last year by the U.S. government.

Previous agreements by the Venezuelan government and its state-run companies over dozens of arbitrations and legal claims related to late President Hugo Chavez's nationalizations have mostly ended in renegotiations and legal disputes.

""What makes this situation and Conoco's claim unique is the amount of creditors lining up behind the very same Venezuelan assets,"" Jay Auslander, partner at New-York based law firm Wilk Auslander, said.

""So Venezuela itself has ample reason to take care of the Conoco problem. How this will all play out over time, though, remains uncertain, because Venezuela may simply lack the liquidity to fully perform.""

Conoco said it will make sure that the settlement meets U.S. regulatory requirements, including any applicable sanctions against Venezuela.

Conoco and Exxon Mobil left Venezuela after they could not reach deals to convert their projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA. The assets were then expropriated.

After receiving two arbitration awards, Exxon said in its most recent quarterly report that the South American country this year finished paying $260 million related to its La Ceiba project.

Separately on Monday, NuStar said it had also reached an agreement with PDVSA that brings the Venezuelan company's accounts current and cover a year's worth of storage in the Caribbean.

PDVSA can resume use of the St. Eustatius terminal, NuStar spokesman Chris Cho said in a statement. The storage agreement secures future fees and improves the earnings outlook for the facility, he said.

Crude ticked up slightly on Friday on expectations of some thawing in the U.S.-China trade row, but oil prices still ended the week lower because of supply concerns and as the U.S. dollar remained close to its highest level in more than 13 months.

West Texas Intermediate and Brent futures rose by less than 0.5% intraday after media reports said Beijing will despatch trade officials to Washington in August, with China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen meeting the U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass to prevent a tariff spat between the two countries from escalating to a full-fledged trade war.

The joint meeting between the two nations, the first since July, offered some confidence to oil market participants, who have experienced a jittery week following the worsening of tensions between the US and Turkey, and a contagion from the near collapse of the Turkish lira spread to emerging-market currencies such as the South African rand and the Indian rupee.

Oil, which has an inverse correlation with the dollar, was firmer on Friday because the dollar retreated on expectations that the world's two largest economies will be able to avoid a full-blown trade war, which is expected to hit global demand as well as undermine investor confidence.

Crude retreated as the dollar strengthened to its highest level since June 2017 on Wednesday as Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused to give into the U.S. demand of extraditing Pastor Andrew Brunson, escalating a crisis between the two North American Treaty Organization allies, driving up demand for the safe-haven greenback.

In addition to the stronger dollar, a surprise surge in crude inventories also put pressure on oil prices, which closed lower for the third in a row.

The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday crude stockpiles jumped by 6.8 million barrels over the week to Aug. 10. That compared with expectations of a 2.5 million-barrel drop in a Reuter's survey of analysts. Surprisingly, the jump in inventories coincided with refinery crude runs advancing to about 18.0 million barrels per day, the highest level ever, data compiled by the EIA showed.

In a report issued last week on Friday, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Brian Singer wrote in a research note the U.S. oil production was 0.5% above their estimates of 21 million barrels per day for the quarter, based on 31 exploration & production companies (E&Ps) and integrated oils that have announced their second-quarter results.

""Based on company commentary/results [for the second quarter], we make downward revisions to our 2H18 US oil forecasts and upward revisions to 2019 quarterly oil production forecasts,"" Singer said. The forecast for 2019 has been raised because E&Ps have increased 2018 capital budgets by 7% on a weighted average basis, with 20 out of 36 E&Ps that have reported results announcing some increase to 2018 spending.

Meanwhile, the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. were flat at 869, the highest level since March 3, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes ( BHGE ), which tracked the seven-day period ending Aug. 17. The combined oil and gas rig count in the US was also flat at 1,057, as gas rigs remained at 186.

In Canada, the number of oil rigs in operation rose by one to 141, while the number of gas rigs increased by two to 71. Consequently, the North American total rose by three to 1,269 in the week and compared with 1,160 a year ago, the data showed.",2018-08-17,

While the results are not really a barn burner, it does compare much favorably with the $121.1 million and $124.76 million, garnered in the first couple of auctions, respectively. The results definitely score a notch higher in terms of greater participation along with increased completion for offerings and bid amounts. While the Lease Sale 249 and 250 drew 159 and 99 bids, respectively, the latest auction reaped 171 bids.



The latest auction had put 801,288 acres of prospective oil/gas development spread over 144 federally owned tracts in GoM's Western, Central and Eastern planning areas for sale.



Notable Mentions



A total of 29 companies including energy supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM , Chevron Corporation CVX BP plc BP , Royal Dutch Shell plc RDS.A , TOTAL S.A. TOT alongside other noted players submitted the bids.



ExxonMobil led the event by submitting 25 bids valued at $40.6 million. These included two bids worth $8.5 million and $7.5 million for De Soto Canyon 939 and De Soto Canyon 983, each.



Surprisingly, Hess Corporation HES , the independent leading energy producer, took away the honor for the single highest bid of $25.9 million for Mississippi Canyon 338. The company placed a total of 16 high bids totaling to $36.2 million, securing the second spot.



Chevron took the third spot with a total of $18.7 million with just five high bids. Notably, the company offered $11.1 million for Mississippi Canyon 743.



Equinor EQNR placed 16 high bids for $13.2 million. It took 19 high bids for BP's sum to reach $12.6 million. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation offered $12.5 million, placing five high bids.



The bids totaled $6.3 million and $5.8 million for Shell plc and TOTAL, respectively.



Results Raise Hope, GoM Shows Signs of Life



After the lukewarm response received from the last auction in March, which was publicized as one of the largest lease sales in American history, there wasn't too much of a buzz of optimism surrounding the Lease Sale 251. Many were of the view that the expensive GoM investments had been put on the back-burner as companies were more inclined toward spending on the low-cost shale plays with less stringent regulations. They have been more focused on onshore shale, which promise quicker returns with less risk.



Meanwhile most companies in the lease Sale 251 were hell-bent on the deepwater acreage around the existing discoveries or fields as against wildcat drilling owing to its low risk and short cycle characteristics. However, ExxonMobil and Equinor demonstrated a higher risk appetite by placing bids on remote blocks, mirroring further signs of resurgence. Both ExxonMobil and Equinor carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



Lease sales remain an indicator for the general health of the offshore energy industry. With the operating environment along with other factors contributing to improved results, GoM might be slowly getting back in the game. The administrative efforts to simplify cumbersome regulations have started to bear fruits, prompting the companies to boost investments in the region. With crude price rally along with rig rates and supply chain prices getting more competitive, the companies have begun to improve operational efficiencies. Reduction of royalty rates from a long-standing 18.75% to 12.5% has also boosted the results and activities in GoM region.



More robust results of Lease Sale 251 both in terms of dollar amounts and the number of bids reflect signs of returning confidence in the region. Though the results have shown immense promise, the recovery rate is slow and it will take quite a while to turn the tide toward GoM again.



Now it is to be seen if oil majors will remain attracted toward GoM acreage sale in the next round, which would primarily depend on the energy prices, regulatory certainty, an improving economy and favorable tax reforms.



Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?



Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.



With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.



It's not the one you think.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/2-bargain-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now-cm1009214,"I'm not going to lie: Finding bargains in the stock market right now isn't easy. Valuations are high, which means that companies are going to have to deliver impressive rates of return for years to make some investments worth it. In even the most expensive market, though, you can find stocks trading at cheap valuations for one reason or another. Luckily for investors, two quality businesses have fallen into cheap-stock territory lately -- homebuilder LGI Homes (NASDAQ: LGIH) and oil and gas behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) .

Let's take a look at what's causing their stocks to trade at bargain-basement valuations these days and why investors may want to pick up shares now.

Image source: Getty Images.

Just what the housing market needs right now

After a long boom, there are signs that the housing market is starting to cool off as concerns about high prices and affordability are keeping potential buyers away. While those high prices have been great for the bottom line of many homebuilders, there are some signs that companies aren't going to be able to pass on these higher prices for much longer. What's worse is that this is happening as homebuilders are gobbling up every spare parcel of land for their next community developments and plowing lots of cash into the most speculative aspect of the homebuilding industry.

If home prices and affordability are the greatest concerns for buyers, then LGI Homes may actually benefit. Unlike other homebuilders that tend to maintain a portfolio mix of entry-level, move-up, and luxury homes, LGI focuses almost exclusively on the first-time buyer. It delivers a more limited set of home designs within its communities without the customization that other homebuyers provide to focus on lower-cost development and keeping its price point down.

This past quarter, LGI Homes' average selling price per home was $231,200. While that price has gone up and is out of the reach of some first-time buyers, the average selling price for most of LGI's competitors is $100,000 more than that. Being able to provide homes at a much lower price point and marketing campaigns geared toward monthly payments commensurate with local home rental rates gives LGI a large pool of buyers that most of its peers ignore today.

LGI Homes' shares have been dragged down with the rest of the homebuilder industry and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.0. While its own rising average sales price could dampen sales , it is still best positioned to cater to the largest buyer demographic these days and is the most likely to march on through this housing swoon.

The growth is in the plan, but not in the earnings reports

ExxonMobil has been getting a lot of attention lately, but not for the right reasons. Even though oil prices are rising, the company's earnings results have been rather tepid because of declining oil and gas production . Concerns that Exxon isn't plowing enough money into developing new sources has scared off investors to the point where its shares aren't that far off the lows we saw when oil prices were less than $30 a barrel. As a result, its stock doesn't warrant the premium it once did compared to its integrated oil and gas peers.

XOM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts .

While it can be agonizing to buy and hold Exxon's stock right now, there is a clear plan in place to grow production and earnings. Management is banking on four core development projects -- Permian Basin shale oil, offshore Guyana, offshore Brazil, and LNG in Mozambique -- and expects to deliver an additional 1 million barrels per day of production between now and 2025. Not only is that a lot more production, but some of these projects have incredible rates of return. Current development plans in Guyana put its breakeven price at less than $10 per barrel. All of these investments, as well as an expanding portfolio of chemical and refining assets, should double Exxon's 2017 operating cash flow even if oil prices stay around $60 a barrel.

I can completely sympathize with investors' frustration over Exxon's apparent lack of growth over the next year or two, but its plan has the potential to generate incredible returns for investors patient enough to hang on and build a position today. Exxon has historically stuck to a long-term plan and doesn't make knee-jerk reactions when the market doesn't like what it's serving at the moment. It's an approach that has worked for decades, and it's hard to see why it won't work this time.

Out of favor for now

Between the broader market headwinds facing LGI Homes or Exxon's seeming inability to capitalize on current trends right now, there are not a lot of people on Wall Street who hold these stocks in high regard -- or at least that's what the valuations of these stocks suggest. For longer-term investors, however, there is an opportunity here for both stocks. In LGI Homes, you have a company that has the right product for today's expensive housing market, and in Exxon, you have a company with a long-term plan that may take some time to materialize but is an attractive one nonetheless. These could make for solid investments that trade at bargain valuations today.

https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eia-reports-shock-inventory-increase-despite-strong-refining-cm1009112,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a shock weekly build despite strong refinery utilization. On a further bearish note, distillate inventories jumped, while domestic oil production continues to be robust.

As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 3% (or $2.03) to end at $65.01 per barrel yesterday - the lowest settlement since Jun 6.

Investors Dump Energy Stocks

The federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR - an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies - down more than 3.5% Wednesday.

The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil XOM and Chevron CVX lost 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. DO , Marathon Oil Corporation MRO , Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC and EOG Resources, Inc. EOG .

Analysis of the EIA Data

Crude Oil: The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 6.8 million barrels for the week ending Aug 10, following a decrease of 1.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.4 million barrels.

Strong domestic production and sharp rise in imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand rose to a record high. In particular, output in the United States have climbed sharply on increased production from shale formations to remain over the 10 million barrels a day threshold since early February.

Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma - the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange - rose 1.6 million barrels to 23.4 million barrels.

Despite last week's shock increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 47 of the last 71 weeks and are down more than 50 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 414.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11% below the year-ago figure though stocks have risen 1% above the five-year average.

The crude supply cover was up from 23.4 days in the previous week to 23.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 26.7 days.

Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down for the sixth time in seven weeks on stronger demand. The 740,000 barrels draw - above the polled number of 500,000 barrels fall in supply level - took gasoline stockpiles down to 233.1 million barrels. Despite last week's decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product still remain 0.9% above the year-earlier level and is 5% over the five-year range.

Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) soared 3.6 million barrels last week. Meanwhile, analysts expected the supply level to increase by 700,000 barrels. The third weekly rise in a row could be attributed to lower demand. Nevertheless, at 129 million barrels, current supplies are 13% below the year-ago level and 8% lower than the five-year average.

Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.5% from the prior week to 98.1% - the highest in 20 years.

About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.

The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.

(RTTNews.com) - Asian stock markets are higher on Friday following the positive cues overnight from Wall Street with investor sentiment bolstered by upbeat corporate earnings results and optimism about U.S.-China trade talks. Crude oil prices edged lower in Asian trades after rising overnight.

The Australian market is modestly higher following the positive cues from Wall Street. Gains by banks and oil stocks were offset by weakness in mining stocks.

In late-morning trades, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index is adding 8.40 points or 0.13 percent to 6,336.70, after touching a low of 6,316.60. The broader All Ordinaries Index is up 11.80 points or 0.18 percent to 6,424.40.

In the currency market, the Australian dollar is lower against the U.S. dollar on Thursday. The local currency was quoted at US$0.7256, down from US$0.7269 on Thursday.

The Japanese market is rebounding, tracking a slightly weaker yen and the positive cues from Wall Street amid upbeat corporate earnings results and news of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is adding 116.52 points or 0.53 percent to 22,308.56, off a high of 22,340.95 in early trades. Japanese shares cut initial losses to end marginally lower on Thursday.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea, Singapore, Shanghai, New Zealand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan are also higher. The markets in Indonesia are closed for the Independence Day holiday.

On Wall Street, stocks closed higher on Thursday following news China has accepted an invitation from the U.S. for a new round of trade talks to be held in late August. A positive reaction to earnings news from Walmart also contributed to the strength on Wall Street.

The Dow spiked 396.32 points or 1.6 percent to 25,558.73, the Nasdaq rose 32.41 points or 0.4 percent to 7,806.52 and the S&P 500 climbed 22.32 points or 0.8 percent to 2,840.69.

The major European markets also moved to the upside on Thursday. While the German DAX Index climbed by 0.6 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both advanced by 0.8 percent.

Crude oil prices advanced on Thursday amid hopes that a fresh round of talks between the U.S. and China later this month would help diffuse trade tensions and allay fears about drop in demand for crude oil.

Aug 17 (Reuters) - An ExxonMobil-operated gas project in Papua New Guinea has agreed a deal to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to a unit of British oil giant BP, said Australia'sOil Search Ltd, a partner in the development.

The agreement, starting this month, will provide BP with about 450,000 tonnes of LNG annually over an initial three-year period, rising to about 900,000 tonnes for the following two years, Oil Search said in a statement on Friday.

It did not give any value for the deal.

The agreement comes a month after Oil Search announced a similar deal with PetroChina Co Ltd.

The company also said that, on behalf of the project, ExxonMobil was in negotiations with several other parties over an additional 450,000 tonnes per year of supply.

Earlier this month, Oil Search resumed operations to produce oil at the Agogo Production Facility, which was knocked out by a major earthquake in Papua New Guinea in February.",2018-08-16,Exxon
https://www.nasdaq.com/article/diamondback-buys-energen-for-92b-in-the-permian-frenzy-cm1008704,"Indeed, Permian deal frenzy has swept the U.S. oil industry of late, bringing about a wave of consolidation in the prolific shale play. The latest energy company to join the bandwagon is Diamondback Energy, Inc.FANG , which is set to acquire Energen Corporation EGN in a mega $9.2-billion deal, in a bid to bolster its Permian presence.



Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Energen increased more than 2.8% to close at $75.20 on Aug 15. On the other hand, shares of Diamondback declined about 12% to close at $117.70, mostly as a reaction to the assumption of the takeover target's debt and concerns over slower expected growth. However, many analysts find the deal lucrative, owing to the synergies associated with the deal and the long-term opportunities it could provide.



Deal Details



The deal is valued at $8.4 billion in equity, wherein Diamondback will exchange 0.6442 shares of its common stock for each share of Energen. Diamondback's bid represents around 19% premium to Energen's closing share price of $71.36 on Aug 13, thus valuing Energen at $84.95 a share. The deal assumes Energen's net debt estimated at $830 million, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $9.2 billion.



Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with its shareholders' consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by the fourth quarter of 2018.



Post the culmination of the deal, Diamondback will own 62% stake in the combined entity and Energen will hold the remaining 38%. The combined company is likely to be valued at around $27 billion.



Deal Motive



Diamondback's core operations are focused on the prolific Permian basin, wherein it holds around 207,000 net acres, providing this upstream player with an enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets. The company has been strategically working to boost its presence further in the shale play. As such, it announced to purchase private-equity backed Permian player Ajax Resources LLC for $900 million in cash and around $300 million in stock.

The deal, which is set for closure by the end of October, will add around 25,493 net leasehold acres to Diamondback's portfolio. Now, with the latest Energen buyout deal, Diamondback is all set to become the third-largest Permian explorer. Diamondback currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

On the other hand, Energen is also one of the noted pure-Permian producers, having a vast portfolio of top-tier acreage in Midland and Delaware Basins. The company has successfully streamlined its portfolio by divesting its non-core assets over the past five years, thereby sharpening its focus and increasing drilling activities in the Permian Basin. In the last reported quarter, Energen recorded total production of 8,862 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) compared with 6,596 MBOE in the prior-year quarter.



The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal. The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in Permian.



Deal Benefits



The deal seems to be quite a prudent move by Diamondback, as it is likely to be immediately accretive to the company's earnings, net asset value and cash flow. The agreement will add around 96,000 acres of tier-1 Permian acreage to Diamondback's portfolio, expanding its position by 57% to a total of 266,000 acres. Net Permian acreage of the combined company will stand at around 366,000 acres.



Pro-forma production for the combined company in second-quarter 2018 was 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), reflecting a 78% surge from Diamondback's output of 124,700 Boe/d.



Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The deal is expected to result in synergies of around $3 billion. The transaction aims to reduce costs through economies of scale.



'Permania' Engulfs U.S. Oil Industry



Even during oil slump, the Permian Basin continued to turn out as a moneymaker for many of the oil producers owing to its low cost-high margin operational structure. The region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters make year-round work possible. Oil production in the region has been recording significant growth, with the current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day (Bpd), which is expected to rise another 2 million Bpd by 2025.



Last year, there had been a flurry of oil deals in the region owing to its attractive economics. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM and Chevron Corporation CVX have been pouring in billions of dollars into the lucrative shale play. Other companies including Noble Energy Inc., Parsley Energy Inc. and Marathon Oil Corporation had inked strategic deals in 2017 to expand their Permian foothold. Oasis Petroleum Inc. also dived into Permian with $946-million acreage buyout in December 2017.



With crude prices rebounding, acquisition deals have picked up further pace with more than $30 billion transactions centered around Permian so far this year. In March 2018, Concho Resources Inc. inked a mega $9.5-billion deal to acquire RSP Permian. In July, BP plc acquired Permian assets worth $10.5 billion from BHP Billiton PLC. A few days back, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, in a bid to sharpen its focus on the prolific Permian, inked a $2.6-billion deal to vend its oil export terminal near Corpus Christi and a West Texas pipeline network. Diamondback-Energen $9.2 billion deal will boost the combined firm's competitive positioning.



Will Consolidation Gain Further Momentum?



While production in the Permian is soaring, takeaway capacity is not increasing in proportion. Due to pipeline capacity constraints, various producers have to sell their products at a discounted rate. Pipeline pinch along with other obstacles have led to an increase in consolidation activity, so that the companies can achieve economies of scale and synergies, thereby boosting their earnings and reducing competition for services. The small and mid-size companies are facing more pressure to secure pipeline transportation services, and hence are seeking ways to expand their scale and efficiency.



With crude prices finally rebounding to hover close to $70 per barrel since a couple of months, more and more oil producers are likely to enhance or capitalize their Permian portfolio.



Small and mid-cap companies operating in the region, including Abraxas Petroleum Corporation, Jagged Peak Energy Inc., Lilis Energy Inc., Resolute Energy Corporation, among others, could become effective targets for consolidation. With its relatively low break-even price, the hectic pace of land grab is set to continue in the Permian basin.

U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas ruled on Tuesday the plaintiffs could go ahead with their suit against Exxon, former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and several financial executives.

The civil suit alleges Exxon and the executives failed to properly account for climate impact to its business and made public statements and financial disclosures that caused its share price to fall.

The decision to proceed “is an important first step in holding one of the world’s most powerful corporations accountable,” said Darren Robbins, an attorney for the plaintiffs, which include the Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters Pension Fund.

Exxon had sought to dismiss the suit, arguing plaintiffs failed to state a claim for the civil action.

“We continue to believe the complaint is meritless and will vigorously defend ourselves from these baseless claims,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri.

The case is one of several, including shareholder and employee lawsuits, centered on whether Exxon has for decades lied about climate change, including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves, and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew.

New York and Massachusetts attorneys general are investigating whether the company misled the public and investors on its statements on climate change, releasing documents showing that Tillerson while at the company had used an email account under a different name to discuss climate-related issues.

Exxon has called those investigations politically motivated.

https://reuters.com//article/us-oil-results/exxon-mobil-chevron-earnings-miss-wall-street-expectations-idUSKBN1KH1NZ,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world’s largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations.

The disappointing results come as much of the U.S. oil industry has been recovering from a three-year downturn in the energy sector, bolstered by higher production and crude prices.

Exxon’s troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron’s miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said.

Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

The results were particularly weak at Exxon, which has been trying to boost operations in a bid to revive a stock price trading at about the same level it was a decade ago.

“Exxon’s definitely sticking out like a sore thumb right now,” said Edward Jones energy analyst Brian Youngberg. “It’s just hard to find anything good in the quarter.”

Despite rising oil prices CLc1LCOc1, Exxon’s production dropped 7 percent and it spent more than $600 million to upgrade refineries in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia.

Exxon called the quarter a “challenging” one for its operations and “well below market expectations.”

Neil Chapman, an Exxon executive and member of the company’s management committee, said he is “not happy” about the ongoing refinery maintenance, adding there is “nothing systemic” about the repairs that would reveal weakness in the refining division.

“We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents,” Chapman said on a conference call with investors.

Exxon earned 92 cents per share, while analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

At Chevron, oil production rose 2 percent and profit spiked, but higher corporate expenses surprised Wall Street. Still, the company announced a $3 billion stock buyback program, long awaited by Wall Street.

“We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a conference call.

Chevron earned $1.78 per share, while analysts expected $2.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), a key rival, posted second-quarter profit on Thursday far below forecasts due in part to weakness in refining.
