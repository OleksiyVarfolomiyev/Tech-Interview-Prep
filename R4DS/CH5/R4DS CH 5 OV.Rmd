#Find all flights that

#Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
filter(flights, dest == 'HOU' | dest == 'IAH')

# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
filter(flights, carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA'  | carrier == 'DL')

# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
filter(flights, month == 7 | month == 8 | month== 9)

# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)

# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
